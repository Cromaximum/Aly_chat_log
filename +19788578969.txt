The two boys were very erect on their horses and carried katanas (samurai swords). They were covered in dust from the long trip, and the silk of his garments hung in tatters. But the farmers who saw them pass knew that there were two gentlemen.

Koichi Junchiro and two brothers were returning home from their parents. Your lord and master had been defeated in war. They had fought hard and courageously but now, despite being young, felt old, sad and tired. Although never be told not even to themselves. Though continue talking as men talk in Japan: a hoarse voice and sharp, as if everything they say, to a question or comment, was a violent order.

The war had taken away and wanted to go as soon as possible to his hometown. So rushing the passage of their horses and stopped just long enough to eat and sleep.

They rested in the hottest hours of the day when the sun was high in the sky, and took advantage to advance to the cool of dawn and the last afternoon.

One night, when they were a few days' journey from his hometown, came to a grove. Junchiro, the youngest, proposed to move forward.

"The forest is thick. The night is cool but not cold. On the other side must be a village or perhaps an inn where we can rest more comfortable.

"We have to take care of our horses," he said Koichi. They need rest. We have no money to buy others. Tomorrow at dawn we will go forward.

Junchiro mocked his brother with all the bad mood that he caused his own weariness. She accused him of cowardice, knowing that was a lie.

"The ghosts of the forest is afraid of a warrior. Or is she afraid of foxes and rabbits?

Koichi, without answering, quietly began his grateful unsaddle horse.

Thinking that after all she was so close to home would not mind go alone (and secretly hoping that it reached Koichi) Junchiro rushed to his horse and entered the grove.

I was going to meet her at the porch. I whispered it, you’re the one who announced it. Yes, your actions don’t expire. And fuck you for calling her a drug addict? You’re an actual asshole, just because you’re mad doesn’t mean you can take it out on her. She did nothing, and you of all people should be understanding of mental reasons for doing drugs.

Not a studio?

May 18, 2020  2:31:06 PM (Read by you after 41 seconds)
+19788578969

That happened to Callans sister recently she thought she was having a heart attack and she’s a nurse so she assumed all the worse medical possibilities and she went to a hospital and they said it was a panic attack, no warning no history of major anxiety either. I can’t even imagine going through that

In El Salvador, the law is clear: If you have an abortion, you go to jail. But many women say they were wrongfully convicted. Could it happen in the U.S.?

The guys are being so weird

Jun 13, 2020  6:29:48 PM (Read by you after 17 minutes, 50 seconds)
+19788578969
So callan and Charlie aren’t sure if they will live at puffton this fall, so now Andrew wants Natalie to live there instead which is putting pressure on the guys to not be there...because she wouldn’t have housing? But the reason she wouldn’t have housing is because umass is making most peoples classes online and is asking others to not come to Amherst if you do not have classes in person. And now its like a weird situation where clearly Andrews preference would be that callan and Charlie dont live in their own apartment. And its just odd because Andrew dated Natalie for a month in person and they’d maybe stayed over each others dorms twice and now hes like prioritizing her moving in with him over them

Jun 13, 2020  6:58:26 PM
Me
Yeah I don’t even know where to begin

Jun 13, 2020  6:58:45 PM (Read by you after 1 minute, 26 seconds)

Like it seems all around a weird idea

Jun 13, 2020  7:00:17 PM

Yeah I have no idea

Jun 13, 2020  7:00:22 PM

I get all sides

It’s just an unfortunate situation

Jun 13, 2020  7:00:40 PM (Read by you after 1 minute, 31 seconds)
+19788578969
It just puts pressure especially on Callan who hasn’t made up his mind yet

Jun 13, 2020  7:02:03 PM (Read by you after 8 seconds)
+19788578969
It seems like a weird pipe dream to move in with someone you haven’t dated for long and they haven’t like done much as a couple physically so like how does that work...but if they’re okay with it it’s not my business. It just seems odd and unnecessary pressure on Callan and Charlie to not move in

Jun 13, 2020  7:02:39 PM
Me
Yeah weird to have such a conflict of interest

Jun 13, 2020  7:04:43 PM (Read by you after 11 minutes, 30 seconds)
+19788578969
kind of a tough situation for callan

Jun 13, 2020  7:05:13 PM (Read by you after 11 minutes)
+19788578969
It just seems kinda stupid to put that kind of pressure on him when the most he’s hung with Natalie is for like 4 hours

Jun 13, 2020  7:09:38 PM (Read by you after 6 minutes, 35 seconds)
+19788578969
And also like this is housing callan has planned to have since last October

Jun 13, 2020  7:16:46 PM
Me
So the situation is either callan or Natalie gets a room?

Jun 13, 2020  7:17:11 PM (Read by you after 15 seconds)
+19788578969
So both callan and Charlie aren’t sure if they are coming yet

Jun 13, 2020  7:17:22 PM (Read by you after 4 seconds)
+19788578969
And if they don’t Andrew wants Natalie to live with him, in his room

Jun 13, 2020  7:17:39 PM
+19788578969
But the guys don’t wanna move in with another person if they’re there

Jun 13, 2020  7:17:54 PM (Read by them after 1 second)
Me
What’s the problem then, if she’s in Andrews room

Jun 13, 2020  7:18:04 PM
Me
They all can stay, rent is cheaper

Jun 13, 2020  7:18:05 PM
+19788578969
That was Charlie and Callans thoughts it’s already a pretty small place only meant for 3 people

Jun 13, 2020  7:18:15 PM
+19788578969
I dunno, it’s just what Charlie and callan want

Jun 13, 2020  7:18:37 PM
Me
I think the circumstances are so strange a compromise might be nice if the alternative is Natalie not getting housing

Jun 13, 2020  7:18:51 PM (Read by you after 1 second)
+19788578969
Well she would get housing if she has classes on campus

Jun 13, 2020  7:18:56 PM
+19788578969
At umass

Jun 13, 2020  7:19:18 PM
+19788578969
If she doesn’t have in person classes umass doesn’t want kids coming to Amherst for safety concerns but Andrew wants her there anyway

Jun 13, 2020  7:19:59 PM
Me
Ok well I guess we gotta find out if she is having in person classes

Jun 13, 2020  7:20:20 PM (Read by you after 6 seconds)
+19788578969
Andrew is convinced she will and regardless wants her there

Jun 13, 2020  7:20:34 PM

Makes sense

Jun 13, 2020  7:20:52 PM (Read by you after 3 seconds)
+19788578969
But it doesn’t seem like something Charlie is super comfortable with her already talked to me about not being comfy with the amount of people that are going to be in contact with each other at puffton

Jun 13, 2020  7:21:03 PM (Read by you after 1 second)
+19788578969
he* not her

Jun 13, 2020  7:21:37 PM

Yeah I guess you gotta weigh the issues, Being uncomfortable vs Natalie not coming here

Jun 13, 2020  7:22:12 PM (Read by them after 1 second)

Personally I think making that option open to her would be the right decision. Far from normal circumstances

Jun 13, 2020  7:22:23 PM (Read by you after 11 seconds)
+19788578969
Well the thing is

Jun 13, 2020  7:22:43 PM (Read by you after 2 seconds)
+19788578969
If umass didn’t invite her to come back that means she doesn’t have in person classes so there’s no pressing need

Jun 13, 2020  7:22:54 PM
+19788578969
So it would make sense not to pressure Charlie and callan?

Jun 13, 2020  7:22:59 PM
+19788578969
Into something unnecessary

Jun 13, 2020  7:23:05 PM
Me
Yeah but I’d understand if she wanted to be back in school

Jun 13, 2020  7:23:21 PM
+19788578969
I guess but to mess up plans that have been in place all year?

Jun 13, 2020  7:23:28 PM
+19788578969
It seems stupid on Andrews part

Jun 13, 2020  7:23:36 PM
Me
It’s not really messing it up if she stays in Andrews room

Jun 13, 2020  7:23:50 PM

Idk I’d be fine with it if I were in that situation

Jun 13, 2020  7:23:56 PM (Read by them after 1 second)

But nobody seems to be losing much

Jun 13, 2020  7:24:00 PM
+19788578969
Yes but it’s about what Charlie and callan want

Jun 13, 2020  7:24:15 PM (Read by you after 1 second)
+19788578969
Charlie is hesitant to come to campus already because he doesn’t want to interact with too many people and risk getting sick

Jun 13, 2020  7:24:33 PM

Makes sense, that is a separate issue

Jun 13, 2020  7:24:36 PM (Read by you after 1 second)
+19788578969

+19788578969
whatever

Jun 13, 2020  7:24:56 PM

Besides Andrew and Natalie haha

Jun 13, 2020  7:25:48 PM (Read by them after 1 second)

I’m positive that Natalie would not choose moving in with Andrew as her first option, may be her only option

Jun 13, 2020  7:26:10 PM

Andrew sure, but he also has to share a small space

Jun 13, 2020  7:26:38 PM (Read by you after 3 seconds)
+19788578969
I think that is the first choice and it just frustrates me bc it was phrased like that’s what Andrew wants the most and now it’s like forcing callan into an awkward spot

Jun 13, 2020  7:26:57 PM
+19788578969
And I’d like to have one person to hang with this fall haha

Jun 13, 2020  7:27:03 PM (Read by them after 1 second)

I feel like I’d totally understand and agree if it were normal circumstances

Callan could move in with you, that’s an option

Jun 13, 2020  7:27:21 PM (Read by you after 1 second)
+19788578969
It’s just that she doesn’t need to be in Amherst so why would Charlie and callan get the bad end of the deal

Jun 13, 2020  7:27:35 PM (Read by you after 1 second)
+19788578969
he wants to live with his friends if he chooses to stay

Callan snd Charlie also don’t need to be in Amherst

Jun 13, 2020  7:27:50 PM

I’m sure they all want to be

Jun 13, 2020  7:28:14 PM

If they don’t move in would callan just stay in swampscott?

Jun 13, 2020  7:28:35 PM (Read by you after 5 seconds)
+19788578969
Well callan and Charlie had this plan and did the house hunting and all the work

Jun 13, 2020  7:28:47 PM
+19788578969
callan is torn and obviously there’s pressure now

Jun 13, 2020  7:28:54 PM (Read by them after 1 second)

What’s he thinking

Jun 13, 2020  7:29:09 PM (Read by you after 1 second)

He genuinely doesn’t know

Jun 13, 2020  7:29:49 PM (Read by you after 7 seconds)
+19788578969

Jun 13, 2020  7:30:04 PM (Read by you after 1 second)
+19788578969
But it’s not my decision to chime in on hence why I’m venting to you

Jun 13, 2020  7:34:42 PM (Read by you after 2 minutes, 2 seconds)

Jun 13, 2020  7:34:46 PM (Read by you after 1 minute, 58 seconds)

She’s very very rich

Jun 13, 2020  7:39:01 PM (Read by you after 1 second)
+19788578969
And like haven’t done anything so they’d like change in separate rooms and it would be so awkward

Jun 13, 2020  7:40:40 PM
+19788578969
I know Andrew and Natalie would make fun of Claire a lot when we’d all hang out so mybe Claire found out about that or she just doesn’t like competition

Jun 13, 2020  7:40:51 PM (Read by you after 1 second)
+19788578969
ahhh but i mean there’s a chance she may get assigned housing

Jun 13, 2020  7:41:02 PM

I hope she can stay on campus she does not need Louisiana

Jun 13, 2020  7:41:08 PM

Yeah Claire definitely is a strange and often hostile person around him, but she does get bullied often

Jun 13, 2020  7:41:24 PM

Yeah I hope she can stay, I think she’ll figure out how

Jun 13, 2020  7:41:28 PM
+19788578969
Yea they’d like laugh about stuff she’d do and I remember when I’d say to take it easy they’d blow it off

Jun 13, 2020  7:41:50 PM
Me
It’s definitely gone too far at times

Jun 13, 2020  7:42:17 PM
+19788578969
She’s a character but there’s no point in making fun of someone when they’re not even actively doing something

Yeah I think some of it was warranted but kind of old news

Jun 13, 2020  7:42:49 PM

Claire has to leave Andrew alone for her sake

Jun 13, 2020  7:42:54 PM
+19788578969
One time Claire knocked on the suite to come in and just Andrew and Natalie were in there, and Andrew didn’t open it. Then callan and I got back and opened it

Jun 13, 2020  7:43:04 PM
+19788578969
Natalie eventually left and Andrew snapped at Claire for knocking on the door

Jun 13, 2020  7:43:18 PM (Read by you after 1 second)

He was like if no one answers leave, but she genuinely just wanted to see Eli or Charlie

Did Claire know it was just them?

Jun 13, 2020  7:43:33 PM (Read by you after 1 second)

So the idea that the north was like this insane industrial superpower is somewhat true, but its also largely part of the post-war campaign of the south to paint the war as “a lost cause”

Jun 16, 2020  8:17:05 PM

The South had a lot more weapons and they were paranoid mofos because they knew that slaves had the numbers to rebel, and there was a precedent of insane rebellions. So southerners were armed to the teeth

Lincoln is an insane leader, he was very veeeerrrry quiet about his plans. He would also do things that would force the South’s hands into making an action, and he privately very early figured out that the US had to go to total war and call for emancipation

He publicly chose not to tell the states that we needed emancipation to beat the south as to not divide them, he waited really strategically for a MASSIVE union victory (antietam) after the North was partying over the south’s failure to say “and by the way, slavery is done”

Like after the civil war and the reconstruction era, black women had so much power in black communities and could even vote in town halls and literally were the body guards holding guns in front of churches to protect everyone. But then black men eventually pushed women away in order to fit in with the more like “regal” type of society that had stronger gender roles. So for a very long black time women were excluded from the history of reconstruction

And no one really brought it up because it seemed distasteful to criticize what was going on when black men had already suffered so much during the reconstruction era, but unfortunately that meant the history of black women became largely forgotten

Yea so I think its super important to acknowledge that every group can have faults, because if we do not acknowledge that we remove a massive part of history. Its so largely forgotten how powerful black women were in black communities because eventually men pushed them out

And that was influenced by white society and how it operates and pressure that black men had to confide into white politics, but all the same its not an excuse to exclude women

I guess I’d just say that often and especially in America white people set the conditions and setting of other cultural groups. So like with the Native American violence in the Midwest, probably caused by relocation

The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people," former Nixon domestic policy chief John Ehrlichman told Harper's writer Dan Baum for the April cover story published Tuesday.

"You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin. And then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities,"

+19788578969
I know the defendants are asking for the court trial to be broadcasted and I’m pretty sure that’s because if they get off as not guilty they want the public to know exactly why

Jun 26, 2020  5:36:55 PM
+19788578969
That I understand because from a practical perspective if you’re the attorney you want to make sure if they win in or not guilty that there’s no doubt in the publics mind that this was a rightful ruling

Jun 26, 2020  5:36:56 PM

I think they are looking for a mistrial if they lose

True this honestly sucks them up really well for advantages on either way

Jun 26, 2020  5:37:29 PM
+19788578969
I think the biggest issue was gonna be a lot of people were upset because it was originally charged us third degree which would be much easier to prove than second degree and right now they’re being charge for second degree I think at least the main guy is

Jun 26, 2020  5:37:37 PM

Finding a jury in the case of a mistrial would be impossible

Jun 26, 2020  5:37:41 PM (Read by you after 4 seconds)

So I think with the higher degree of charge it is going to be easier for them to find a way to be not guilty

Jun 26, 2020  5:37:57 PM (Read by you after 1 second)

Like there is zero way that they could ever be convicted on first degree

There’s a bunch of different ways that you can charge second- degree all with varying intent and knowledge but the main thing it comes down to is that they knew their actions were going to kill that person

Jun 26, 2020  5:40:52 PM
+19788578969
And I’m sure the attorney is beefing up a hella good statement on how that guy had no idea that this would kill him

I am really curious who they are going to pick for a jury I have a feeling they’re going to have to redo their selection because I just don’t see how you can have a black person on the jury who doesn’t already have a preconceived perception of cops, but people will obviously raise eyebrows with that

Through both my academic and professional experiences, I have developed strong interpersonal, research, and writing skills. In the Spring of 2020 I completed an internship with the former Commerce Department Under Secretary for International Trade Robert LaRussa, which required researching trade policies and producing briefs. Using government data, academic sources, and primary sources, I produced a comprehensive presentation and research paper on the short- and long-term effects of NAFTA on diplomatic and economic relations with Canada and Mexico.

I think you should do something like that, it doesnt have to be as specific, but maybe focus on how you have both very strong computer skills but also have learned really strong writing skills and why that combo will be very important in an office setting

I think the best thing that you can do is move on from both of those girls and try to start fresh and go out and meet new people you can connect with just as well but if you keep holding on to this girl who could’ve been in your ex then you’re never going to meet new girls who you can have the same connection with

Here are my pros:

Jul 29, 2020 10:26:14 PM (Read by you after 15 seconds)
+19788578969
My pros are

-greyhounds are large, almost hypoallergenic, but lazy which hits every box I want
- it forces me to go outside and get exercise multiple times a day
- helps with anxiety when I have a pet around
- would be less scared walking around the world with a pet
- would help when I am alone bc I usually have 3-4 nightmares a night so a dog presence would be cool
- sleeps almost as much as I do 
- greyhounds apparently love cars and handle car rides well so it’s portable 

Con
- I will be busy in law school, but also all adults with dogs have full time jobs
- at least 10 year commitment, but I also like the fact that I have so much time so that’s more of a pro 
- ???

Me
Yeah tbh I feel like I liked her a lot as a homie but idk how long she was just trying to get close to me

Oct 10, 2020 11:05:56 AM

And honestly our little fling was a product of me processing a serious breakup. Not ok, but it’s over now and I’m doing other stuff mostly by myself

Oct 10, 2020 11:06:15 AM

yeah thats true, I could wait until the falll

But you could apply super super early next fall

If you use 7sage law school predictor, early applicants get a major boost while if you apply later its harder and you get no money bc its already used up

Oct 13, 2020  1:54:51 PM (Read by you after 13 seconds)

But on a more fun note, where are you looking! Tell me about your top schools

if I can get a great LSAT score ill also apply to BC probably

i mean so is every law school

Oct 13, 2020  1:58:57 PM

BC does not give money at all

Oct 13, 2020  1:59:00 PM

BU is where you’d wanna apply

Oct 13, 2020  1:59:10 PM

BC is known for not giving anything to anyone, its a super rich kid law school

Oct 13, 2020  1:59:17 PM

BU is much more forgiving and has a great public interest program

Oct 13, 2020  1:59:23 PM

BC is known for its corporate law

You should look at western New England school of law. Basically everyone who works in the public service sector of the mass court system comes from there. They pump out public service kids

Didn’t you say you wanted a higher income

Oct 14, 2020  2:04:57 PM
Me
yes but I feel like I can make investments as a fraction of my income considering I don’t want kids and I live small

Oct 14, 2020  2:05:12 PM

even with a small rate of return if I start investing now it can grow pretty quickly

since I started at seaview Ive put about 2 grand in a vanguard total stock market (VTI) ETF

Oct 14, 2020  2:05:53 PM

and a little bit in fixed income bonds international and national

Oct 14, 2020  2:07:20 PM

I can get bonds super cheap now because the interest rates are zeroed practically, so if I wait until the economy recovers I can make a good return

Oct 14, 2020  2:08:39 PM

except im buying all my bond shares as an ETF so it will be passively managed

Look things may not turn out great and yeah sure I’ve got options but I’m really interested in law and I study 5 days a week for it.

I appreciate you giving me advice and stuff and you are my number 1 trusted advisor haha but idk man, im going through a lot and studying for this test and the idea of getting involved with the law excites me. I am already aware of all of these downsides from you and other advisors. I guess during this time waaaaay before I commit to anything I would just like some pumping up, some help, ya know. Stuff like instead of being highly critical over what I was thinking would be a good personal statement maybe workshop some other ideas just so it seems like you aren’t trying to flatly discourage me. I know the law stuff was your career path first and I don’t want to be like cramping your style or anything but idk, I like it, and its what I want to do

Oct 14, 2020  3:39:42 PM
+19788578969
I think you are rushing into it and not doing a lot of research so id like to help you. You have said yourself you get hooked onto topics before and I think you should take time. If you are so sensitive about it maybe you need to take some time to become more confident about it.

The way I was thinking about it is if I got sick and people ask why and if I have to explain that it’s because I went to a Thanksgiving with people who came from six different states I’m going to be locked up and that was when I realized yeah not a good idea

We went through the cabinets and there was so much expired food because they buy so much that we were dying laughing so I ended up taking it all back to my place it’s like crackers I don’t care if it’s expired and Lorna would show me her shopping list and should be like we already have six bags of sweet potatoes and then she was saying that the kids will not take their own dog outside she was shocked that I was taking dad to be outside because she was like she will be upstairs in the kids will be downstairs in all of her needs to go outside they will not take him out

translation: Maxwell Rhinelander:	I have an attention deficit so of course I forgot to buy my motor vehicle liability insurance. Fortunately, my father is still alive; he was a ship's captain and works with the Danube Steamship Company. Eventually he received the Workers Injury Insurance Act. As a youngster, I had the Federal Training Assistance Act, which enabled me to become a government representative.

its like our ancestors hunted to survive, they used every part of the animal and it perpetuated humanity. Now we can survive on vegan diets, so hunting is just for fun

but in a world with dwindling wildlife i think its a bad idea, except for deer around here. Because we killed off all the wolves we actually need hunters to cull the deer population

Was zum Teufel hast du grade über mich gesagt, du kleine Schlampe? Du solltest wissen, dass ich meine Ausbildung beim GSG9 als Jahrgangsbester abgeschlossen habe, in mehrere Kommandounternehmen gegen Al-Kaida involviert war und über 300 bestätigte Tötungen habe. Ich bin in Gorillakriegsführung ausgebildet und der beste Scharfschütze im deutschen Bundesheer. Du bist für mich nichts als ein weiteres Ziel. Ich werde dich mit einer nie zuvor gesehenen Präzision vom Antliz dieser Welt tilgen, merk dir meine verdammten Worte. Du denkst du könntest hier im Internet so eine Scheiße über mich erzählen und damit durchkommen? Denk lieber nochmal darüber nach, du Wichser. Während wir uns hier unterhalten, habe ich schon mein geheimes Netzwerk aus Spionen kontaktiert und deine IP-Adresse wird grade rückverfolgt, also mach dich besser auf den Sturm gefasst, du Made. Der Sturm, der das erbärmliche kleine Ding, das du als dein "Leben" bezeichnest, auslöschen wird. Du bist verdammt nochmal tot, Junge. Ich könnte jederzeit überall sein, und dich auf über siebenhundert verschiedene Arten töten, nur mit meinen bloßen Händen. Aber ich bin nicht nur im unbewaffneten Kampf ausgebildet, ich habe auch Zugriff auf das Waffenarsenal der Bundeswehr und ich werde es aufs Vollste ausschöpfen, um deinen elendigen Arsch von diesem Kontinent zu blasen, du kleiner Scheißkerl. Wenn du nur gewusst hättest, was für eine apokalyptische Rache dein kleiner "witziger" Kommentar provoziert hat, hättest du vermutlich dein verdammtes Maul gehalten. Aber nein, das hast du nicht hinbekommen, das wolltest du nicht, und jetzt wirst du dafür bezahlen, du verdammter Idiot. Du wirst in meinem Hass ertrinken. Du bist tot, Junge.

BIRDS were actually a covert project started in the 1950s, by president Eisenhower however the project was tabled due to technological issues. During Reagan’s second term in 1987 he approved the B.I.R.D program through the current CIA director William Casey. The (B)ipedal, (I)ntensive, (R)eclusive, (D)rones Act. However, the „A“ was later dropped. The first models were rolled out shortly after Casey’s death in 1987. Pigeons were the first model introduced to high population centers, today they are the most produced model and continue to monitor cities on a massive scale. The next generation of (S)entient, (O)pen, (N)ext, (G)eneration BIRDS were eventually introduced to keep watch over the suburbs. In 1992 the SONG birds , the CIA contacted a number of distributers with covert production contracts. So tat is why we see a wide range  of SONG birds. Eventually the models became more sophisticated and could travel longer distances without recharging.  In order to watch rural areas

One of the shadiest things trump has done was trying his absolute best to force the hand of the federal reserve (a separate institution from his control) to lower interest rates as much as possible. This is very bad long term but would boost the economy short term to help his election chances

Because, when a recession comes (it always will) we lower interest rates so its easier to borrow money and boost the economy. It takes a long time to slowly raise rates up to build up this shield. Trump would have us completely kneecapped for any future recession in order to help his reelection chances

umm in 2029 or whatever year when interest rates are only at 2% and we drop them to 0% right away with little to no effect and thus millions of Americans suffer, that would be directly Trump’s fault if he had succeeded

LegalEagle
Do you want to know how our legal system works?  You’ve come to the right place.  LegalEagle is all about giving you an insider’s view to the legal system.  Have some fun and learn to think like a lawyer.  

I get asked a lot about whether being a practicing attorney is like being a lawyer on TV.  I love watching legal movies and courtroom dramas.  It's one of the reasons I decided to become a lawyer.  But sometimes they make me want to pull my hair out because they are ridiculous.  So I created this channel to answer your burning questions about the law and the legal profession.  While all legal movies and shows take dramatic license to make things more interesting (nobody wants to see hundreds of hours of brief writing), many of them have a grain of truth.  Learn everything you always wanted to know about being an attorney!

If you’re a law student or thinking about law school, check out my other channel made specifically for law students and 0Ls here: https://goo.gl/e3kEHL

Vintage sizing! Please check measurements (in pics) against a jacket that you already wear.

Light athletic jacket with mesh inside. Big pockets, snap at collar.

This jacket is in great vintage shape. The elastic has lost a bit of stretch, particularly in one sleeve. There is also a random green thread caught in the collar, which can be fixed by opening it up, but I will leave that up to the buyer. See pic

Its quite a brain puzzle, because you obviously dont want a route to hav multiple of the same shapes because if it picks up a different shape it takes space and takes longer

Yea that static is major frizz and a sign that you shouldn’t brush your hair or touch it once its dry bc its a moisture black hole

What im guessing is happening is bc you shampoo so much your hair immediately replaces the oil so it gets very oily very fast

There is usually an adjustment period when you stop using as much shampoo but after a bit your hair begins to calm down and understand that it doesn’t need to go in full panic mode every time you strip it off essential oils

There is one thing that I really like to do with my hair if its mega dry and just not having a good time. Buy some coconut oil, its solid at room temperature, you scoop some out and microwave it so it becomes a total liquid, and then you put it on your hair before you shower like a hair mask. And then you shampoo and rinse it out and your hair is insanely soft and smooth and health

Jan 16, 2021  3:51:06 PM

wow thats pretty extra haha

Game stop’s stock was predictably falling so an estimated 85% of stock holders were shorting the stock. Essentially betting it’ll go down. But a guy published an essay saying that the valuation of company assets doesn’t match the stock price and basically got the entire subreddit to buy GameStop stock en Masse.

Short Selling
Short selling occurs when an investor borrows a security, sells it on the open market, and expects to buy it back later for less money.

Yeah so basically a guy borrows stocks, sells them. And then at a certain date has to return the stocks. So ideally the price is lower and the guy can just buy the stocks and pocket the difference

Jan 26, 2021  1:33:28 PM

Except now all these borrowed stocks are coming to term and they have to buy stock higher than what they sold for haha

“Imagine a trader who believes that XYZ stock—currently trading at $50—will decline in price in the next three months. They borrow 100 shares and sell them to another investor. The trader is now “short” 100 shares since they sold something that they did not own but had borrowed. The short sale was only made possible by borrowing the shares, which may not always be available if the stock is already heavily shorted by other traders.

A week later, the company whose shares were shorted reports dismal financial results for the quarter, and the stock falls to $40. The trader decides to close the short position and buys 100 shares for $40 on the open market to replace the borrowed shares. The trader’s profit on the short sale, excluding commissions and interest on the margin account, is $1,000: ($50 - $40 = $10 x 100 shares = $1,000).”

So using my equation above, a hedge fund borrows 10,000 GameStop stock at $180,00. They sell ALL of it hoping to give back the borrowed shares by buying them back at a lower price. But now the 10k stock is worth just over a million

Jan 26, 2021  1:42:18 PM

So someone shorting 10k GameStop would be down about 850k rn

OG explanation

Jan 29, 2021  2:08:03 PM (Read by them after 1 second)
Me
“It started as a gamble to make money for many on WSBs.  Then the hedge funds decided to fuck around. And now they're about to find out what "fuck around and find out" really means.  Add in a bit of Streisand Effect and some class awareness from millennials... and well... here we are.

You've got millions of millennials with nothing to lose who can remain irrational and petty and spiteful far longer than hedge funds can remain solvent.  What does a single millennial investor really care if they lose out on $1k in GME stock?  If they lose 1k they're still a corporate slave.  But they could make that 1k turn into $10k while the hedge funds burn and Wallstreet, who fucked up our job prospects and saddled us with unreasonable student debt in 2008, cry uncle and pay through the teeth.

It seems like a worthy gamble to many of them, myself included.”

Feb 03, 2021 10:16:57 AM (Read by you after 1 second)
+19788578969
Well now their drivers license with the different spelling is expired so she needs to get a new one, but in order to do that she needs her birth certificate

I see no potential legal problems there

Feb 03, 2021 10:17:57 AM

His problem is that his birth certificate was stolen and now has the wrong information lmao

Feb 03, 2021 10:18:12 AM (Read by you after 1 second)
+19788578969
And also the last name is spelled completely different than the other persons legal name/ID name

Feb 03, 2021 10:18:36 AM
+19788578969
And now the person who wants a name change has a crazy aunt who may have taken her first birth certificate and used it to name her child so they share the same name

Hm

I had a fun claims case yesterday, it was $10k in claims so thats no longer a small claims and there isn’t a form since its a bit more complicated. That was neat it switched things up

Yeah so if it’s above the small claims limit then doesn’t it have to go to like a full civil suit?

They offered me the position twice and told me to consider it

Feb 11, 2021  7:08:06 PM
Me
It was all just BS?

Feb 11, 2021  7:08:11 PM
+19788578969
Maybe they thought you’d say no because you weren’t immediately interested

Feb 11, 2021  7:08:22 PM
Me
I even emailed to follow up so that they knew I wanted it

Feb 11, 2021  7:08:31 PM
Me
And they said it’s all good take your time

Feb 11, 2021  7:08:39 PM
Me
I wanted to make sure the offer still stood

Feb 11, 2021  7:09:36 PM
Me
Like I was concerned about that so I reached out

Feb 11, 2021  7:09:41 PM
Me
And they said it was fine

Feb 11, 2021  7:09:55 PM
+19788578969
That’s very weird, maybe they thought you may not pick them. Maybe americorps moves fast

Feb 11, 2021  7:09:59 PM

They offered me the job over zoom and formally

Feb 11, 2021  7:10:14 PM

12 days ago

Feb 11, 2021  7:10:20 PM
Me
And I followed up twice

Feb 11, 2021  7:10:21 PM
Me
Wtf

Feb 11, 2021  7:10:44 PM
Me
Maybe it would have been nice to be updated that that offer doesn’t exist

Feb 11, 2021  7:11:08 PM
+19788578969
I’m sorry about that. Perhaps the typical move in Americorps is to accept right away. Not sure

Feb 11, 2021  7:11:28 PM
Me
They couldn’t wait a week so I can decide

Feb 11, 2021  7:11:39 PM
Me
Now all the sudden I have no offers

Feb 11, 2021  7:11:44 PM
Me
No prospects

Feb 11, 2021  7:12:02 PM
+19788578969
They may get back to you! Who knows. Maybe send them an email to show your continued interest

Feb 11, 2021  7:12:13 PM
Me
I was told I could start in less than a month BY THEM

Feb 11, 2021  7:12:17 PM
Me
I did

Feb 11, 2021  7:12:28 PM
Me
I’ve kept in touch but they never told me this

Feb 11, 2021  7:12:45 PM
Me
I canceled my other interviews to accept this job

Feb 11, 2021  7:13:34 PM
+19788578969
Fingers crossed it’ll work out

Feb 11, 2021  7:14:11 PM

Idk if I even wanna work there if they screwed me this hard

Feb 11, 2021  7:14:44 PM

Feb 11, 2021  7:15:06 PM

How do you fake offer someone a job

Feb 11, 2021  7:16:41 PM

+19788578969
It is very unfair I am sorry

Feb 11, 2021  7:17:15 PM
Me
I literally started my research to be prepared

Feb 11, 2021  7:17:20 PM
+19788578969
I would refrain from sending them anything confrontational so it doesn’t affect any other Americorps offers

Feb 11, 2021  7:17:28 PM
Me
Yeah I know I won’t

Feb 11, 2021  7:17:48 PM
Me
I just sent an email saying I was confused and quoted our other emails

Feb 11, 2021  7:17:58 PM
Me
Said I was sorry for “my” misunderstanding

Feb 11, 2021  7:18:28 PM
Me
But I canceled two interviews for this absolute garbage

Feb 11, 2021  7:19:22 PM
+19788578969
:/ I’m sorry I don’t really know why they’d do that

Feb 11, 2021  7:19:59 PM
Me
I said in a follow up email exactly halfway between my interview and now saying ““If the position is urgent I can absolutely reach out to the other AmeriCorps coalitions to attempt to speed along the process””

Feb 11, 2021  7:20:33 PM
Me
They said essentially...”"please take your time in choosing the best fit for yourself.” - 2/3/21

Feb 11, 2021  7:20:40 PM
+19788578969
Hopefully they can provide any clarification on the situation in their next email

“Growing up we were taught that the US was the greatest civilization in history. And somehow our wars were our way of sharing our greatness with the rest of the world. What an amazing lie that was. The people of the world are *terrified* by the US. They don't see our greatness. They *hate* us. And we deserve it! We created an era of fear in the world. And if we don't want the world to destroy itself, we need to replace it with an era of peace and kindness.”

I did my own math too, they said that their goal Is to reduce financial instability by 25% in 4 years, 285k in poverty, (9.5%), that would be uplifting a lower bound of 71,250 people

Yeah like if a certain percentage of students have Ivy League grades, assuming we have perfect equity. Then we wold have a LOT more lower class students. I think the obvious fact that we don’t live in a perfectly equitable society shows that only the rich can get into these schools so therefore they are more like a participation trophy for being born wealthy

But then you gotta step back and look, I’m a college graduate with a great GPA. Not a lot of people get that opportunity. Just like how you call yourself ugly, you’re just reaffirming yourself and honestly if you want confidence scroll through tinder or something

But then you realize he was a nobody in the cog of the wheel, but at the same time no big guy was around to prosecute, and then you find out he spoke out to stop Holocaust deniers, but then you realize he had lived his life without punishment, and then he says that he knows he is morally responsible but it’s up to everhone if he is criminally responsible, but then he tries to appeal

They used to test Wehrmacht soldiers by making them execute people. Most couldn’t do it

Feb 20, 2021  7:21:22 PM

But the SS was the magnet for every psychopathic murderer to fulfill their fantasies with no punishment

Feb 20, 2021  7:21:39 PM

But also the Wehrmacht did execute a TON of people so they aren’t innocent

Feb 20, 2021  7:23:54 PM (Read by you after 5 seconds)
+19788578969
I also think that letting people go because they didn’t murder people first hand is such a dangerous precedent where you obviously would have to establish and have direct evidence of someone actually killing someone to prosecute them so I think that’s why they never went without because it would literally be even harder to get anyone in trouble

Feb 20, 2021  7:24:15 PM
+19788578969
Because that way if you actually did murder them if someone didn’t have video evidence which is true for most people they could get free

Feb 20, 2021  7:24:46 PM (Read by them after 1 second)
Me
That’s true evidence would have been semi difficult I believe the nazis burned most documents

Feb 20, 2021  7:25:50 PM

If you look at the crime of murder and accessory to murder then the entire German army is guilty, over 3 million at the time I believe

Feb 20, 2021  7:25:51 PM (Read by you after 1 second)
+19788578969
Also if you limit the charges of murder to the guy who pulled the lever to release gas into the chambers you’re basically assuming that every other Nazi wasn’t *that* bad/murderous, it was just that one specific job of lever pulling that holds all of the moral implications of the third reich. Which can’t be true, so the argument just doesn’t hold uo

Feb 20, 2021  7:26:35 PM (Read by them after 1 second)

Yeah The guy can’t pull the lever if all the other guys aren’t doing their jobs

Feb 20, 2021  7:26:44 PM

Makes everyone guilty

Feb 20, 2021  7:27:16 PM

Plus honestly as a human being I think you should sacrifice your life instead of gassing a room full of people

+19788578969
I don’t think it would have made sense to go after everyone in the army because conscription happened and in that case the US would have a lot of murderers on their hands too. But volunteer positions like SS...yea that’s an instant charge

Feb 20, 2021  7:27:50 PM

Like at a certain point we have a moral responsibility to save human lives

So like assuming you are literally at the poverty line, not that far below it. You would still spend literally all of your money on an average apartment, in fact you’d be down 528 dollars after the year. Not sure how people even live, 9.5% of OC is in poverty

Hi, I'm T1J. (Also known as "the1janitor")
This channel is mostly video essays about things that interest me, usually from a progressive point of view. I also livestream weekly. Sometimes I do other stuff too tho.

Although my videos are never intentionally offensive or shocking; and I try very carefully to be sensitive, I often discuss controversial and potentially triggering topics. So my channel should not be consider safe for people who have triggers of any sort. I've chosen not to provide specific content warnings on each individual video. Consider this a content warning for the entire channel.

Say hi to me! hello@the1janitor.com

I’m not sure if I totally believe it’s 100% woman’s autonomy because at there is another life involved. I think it’s a morally gray area where there are so many factors

Reasons why we keep Lee Statues 

•	⁠His dad might have known George Washington
•	⁠He lived near a spot they built a cemetery
•	⁠He killed a bunch of slaves when they tried to revolt
•	⁠He said slavery was bad because it somehow gave black people an advantage according to him
•	⁠He could have fought for the union but actively chose to fight for the Confederacy
•	⁠After slaves were free he believed they shouldn't be allowed to vote
•	⁠He died from a stroke
•	⁠He was buried under a chapel near his horse

Just had a very interesting webinar on vaccine equity. Lots of new ideas for me. Like Boston opted against a making Fenway a mass vax site because of it being walking distance for white people who already have the means.

My favorite backhanded compliment of that is when he tells us he loves wearing UMass gear around the rich because he loves to show off that his kids go to the state school while the other kids go to an Ivy League like does he think we’re a weird petting zoo it’s so demeaning he’s not holding us up to a higher standard he’s making us feel like UMass sucks because it is a statement to wear around rich people?

Aly you see as a woman you clearly don’t understand sports. It’s a mans world I get it haha. Often times when games are considered boring by women they can be exciting for people who know things about sports. Hockey is a very complicated sport where men try to shoot pucks into a net. There is so much to learn and I understand all of it perfectly so don’t be afraid to ask I understand it’s difficult for you

Obtaining a German Law Degree
To earn a law degree in Germany, students must take two state exams and go through a 6 year long curriculum. First, students must pass the First State Examination at the end of 4 years of undergraduate studies. They must then take a two-year internship (called Referendarzeit) to gain experience in all facets of the legal system. Finally, a second State Examination is given to students finishing the two years of legal internships in criminal and civil court. During the internship, students must also take classes taught by lawyers or judges. Wages paid to the student are provided by the German government. Potential lawyers in Germany have two chances to pass State Examinations. After passing both examinations, the student is considered qualified to seek employment as a judge or a lawyer.

So I have had this reoccurring problem with a girl I am with and her ex. I learned over the three months we have been dating that she still hangs out with him regularly. So last night we talked and so like the story is becoming more clear. So she was friends with this guy for a while, and dated him for 4 years. They then broke up but never stopped seeing each other and going out for the next two years. Now she originally had told me that they were completely just friends and “the thought of touching him makes her want to vomit.” However, turns out just before we started talking (she say’s nothing happened after) she regularly cuddled with this guy because thats just what friends do in her social groups I guess? So that includes like spooning, hand holding, etc. She also apparently cuddles with another guy friend of hers. And also apparently it wasn’t just platonic because she admitted 3 months later that she suspected he had feelings for her. So now I am like, why are you going on dates and cuddling with a guy you suspect likes you when you claim to be not interested at all. A week or so ago she I guess “broke up” with him? I used language like break up and she never challenged it. He was sobbing and she was super upset too. Like the original story going in was that we were both years away from bad long term relationships. Had a lot to work through, and haven’t had anything going on for a while

“Roosevelt’s Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938—passed as part of New Deal legislation—set minimum wage at 25 cents. Roosevelt intended this rate to be “more than a bare subsistence level.” The minimum wage was created expressly to ensure that people of all skill-levels, if they worked, could “earn a decent living” off those wages—thus, a living wage.”

Hey, mom reached out to me and said you had some concerns. I have been deeply hurt ever since you wouldn’t understand me wanting to stay in my room. For so many years out of love - not out of chore- I stayed up late, walking in the dark around campus to find you, was there for you about Effie when no one else was. Handled your medicine. Left so many events freshman year to check on you. And I would do all of it again out love. During that time I was so open about how hard it is not having a permanent place so when you went around my back to mom so I wouldn’t stay in my room during that once in a lifetime week, I felt horribly betrayed. I had done so much for you out of love and kindness and would do all of it again and to see that all of my conversations about home insecurity just be rejected like that really really hurts. I’d still do anything for you and it killed me to hear that none of this was reciprocated. I also feel that you make everything we do into a competition when I do not see it that way at all. I pointed you in the direction of Americorp because it is a great program. I have no interest in competing or trying to be the best sibling but it seems to be interpreted that that is the way things are. It is deeply hurtful and that is why I have been distant. I’d do anything and everything to help you out and it is not enough and it is mentally exhausting

I dont feel comfortable sharing any accomplishments with you because you always take it the wrong way. Or if I ask about your job. You implement your own narrative and make up your own mind about how someone is acting instead of listening to them.

“Telperion's [silver treee] descendants



Because the Elves that first came to Valinor especially loved Telperion, Yavanna made a second tree like it to stand in the city of Tirion where the Vanyar and Ñoldor dwelt together at first. This tree, named Galathilion, was identical to Telperion except that it gave no light of its own. It had many seedlings, one of which was planted in the isle of Tol Eressëa (named Celeborn).
In the Second Age, a seedling of Celeborn was brought as a gift to the Númenóreans - this was Nimloth, the White Tree of Númenor. It lasted through the majority of the realm's duration, but when Sauron took control of the island he commanded King Ar-Pharazôn to chop it down.
Fortunately Isildur managed to save a single fruit of that tree. Of this fruit later came the White Tree of Gondor.”

Ahh I see

Nov 15, 2021  9:43:13 PM
+19788578969
I feel like it’s tough bc you can’t control how kids spend their time

Nov 15, 2021  9:43:24 PM

But I would push all kids into taking a careers class and clubs and shit like that

I’ve gone to a few alumni events and those have been the most impactful

Nov 15, 2021  9:43:56 PM

Because almost everyone either doesn’t work in their major or doesn’t use the material

Nov 15, 2021  9:44:03 PM

Nov 15, 2021  9:45:45 PM

It’s a tough thing to balance bc they invite their successful alumn who donate a lot of money

Nov 15, 2021  9:45:46 PM
Me
Yeah because $$$$$

Nov 15, 2021  9:45:55 PM
+19788578969
So they very carefully pick students which isn’t very fair

Nov 15, 2021  9:45:56 PM
Me
The more confused students are the more money

Nov 15, 2021  9:46:36 PM
+19788578969
I feel like it’s very easy to fall under the radar here

Nov 15, 2021  9:47:00 PM
+19788578969
And I’m not sure if that’s something we have to accept and say it’s up to kids to see how involved they want to be or if we should assess if we can do more even if it annoys students

Nov 15, 2021  9:48:06 PM

The schools that do like half a semester of classes then half internship seem cool

Nov 15, 2021  9:48:14 PM

Exactly and the only way to know that is through experience, but it’s hard to get when you’re a full time student

Nov 15, 2021  9:49:03 PM
+19788578969
So something has to give

Nov 15, 2021  9:49:07 PM
Me
Yeah we are in a huge bubble

Nov 15, 2021  9:49:17 PM
+19788578969
And ultimately school feels like such a big deal when you’re in it I’m not surprised most kids choose school

Nov 15, 2021  9:49:25 PM
+19788578969
It’s what you’re led to believe

Nov 15, 2021  9:49:41 PM

16 Penn swimmers say transgender teammate Lia Thomas shouldn't be allowed to compete

If it’s 456 to 1st place then definitely unfair, it’s like if you take steroids in baseball and hit twice as many home runs

“We fully support Lia Thomas in her decision to affirm her gender identity and to transition from a man to a woman," the letter reads. "Lia has every right to live her life authentically. However, we also recognize that when it comes to sports competition, that the biology of sex is a separate issue from someone’s gender identity.
"Biologically, Lia holds an unfair advantage over competition in the women’s category, as evidenced by her rankings that have bounced from #462 as a male to #1 as a female. If she were to be eligible to compete against us, she could now break Penn, Ivy, and NCAA Women’s Swimming records; feats she could never have done as a male athlete.”

It’s just they are in town, and they both ask if I’m around. Which is nice of them but I literally established that I’m not interested in talking to them a million times

And Esther never apologized for like the last time we talked, when she snapped at me

I think perhaps they’d rather reach out to you and be rejected than ignore you, so at least in their minds they are doing the “right” thing

I will say, over the summer Esther would come up to me and be like “so what’s up with max” and that literally felt like being stabbed in the heart. I would just dismiss it like please don’t ask me to speak about my brother to your liking. Sometimes even the younger daughter I forget if it’s hannah or Sophie.

Like to me they just are all unethical pretty plain and simple? Posting photos of a location to advertise an entire different one is totally wrong, cherry picking diverse students to misrepresent a campus is super problematic for like a trillion reasons, editing people’s appearances has had like absolutely colossal impacts on self esteem even more so now, taking dishonest photos to sell a house? Thats insane, using fake food is common I get it but that’s also just straight up misleading and unethical even if its common. Its literally false advertising

I have this amazing sort of male role model position with a very challenging 2nd grader. He’d avoid everyone but would always give me hugs. I’d always try to stick with him. If he had a meltdown we’d walk all over the field until he’d calm down. He’s soooo smart too, he’d always ask me to help him but I basically just chatted with him while he did his work on his own. I bring my own football and soccer ball for the kids to use during recess when I’m out there. He absolutely loves football. It’s so funny he was obsessed with trying for one handed catches 😆. Semi concerning seeing a 2nd grader absolutely launch himself to catch a ball that’s honestly within arms reach. Today was his last day before moving back home after not even finishing one year here. Gave him my football. He’s literally so sweet and misunderstood. I’m going to miss him so much and it’s really hitting me now I’ve been like crying for an hour. I hope he gets what he needs back in California. It’s absolutely so unfair for him

Girl has been through some god awful shit. Her abusive step mom just died and she has to deal with the funeral and everhone saying how nice she was and how lucky she was, and now she’s stuck with her abusive dad. But throughout all this she’s literally the nicest person I’ve ever met

It’s sort of a balance I’ve found. You can reach a point where you hate yourself so much that you can only find validation by being super kind and helpful with the goal of people liking you. Always a balance. Selfishness is important as well

It’s tricky sometimes because I hat validation from others can make you hate yourself more if you don’t get it. And the pain of not getting that validation causes a lot of scary short term pain but long term gain

Jul 02, 2022  6:46:30 PM
+19788578969
Yes I did tell callan and he didn’t agree

Jul 02, 2022  6:46:32 PM

Well you gotta say “this is how I feel and I need space regardless”

Jul 02, 2022  6:47:08 PM
Me
It’s totally valid

Jul 02, 2022  6:47:27 PM

I always thought Sami was super close to you from her TikTok’s 😆

Jul 02, 2022  6:47:31 PM
+19788578969
he said I have issues being the only girl in a group and just want attention and I’m making a big deal outta nothing etc etc

Jul 02, 2022  6:47:49 PM
Me
Like you want to be the only girl in the group?

Jul 02, 2022  6:48:22 PM
+19788578969
Yea which isn’t true

Jul 02, 2022  6:49:06 PM
Me
Well I mean like regardless it’s totally valid to feel uncomfortable

Jul 02, 2022  6:49:19 PM
Me
And you shouldn’t put yourself in unnecessary uncomfortable situations

Jul 02, 2022  6:49:38 PM

So space is ok and it’s your absolute right to set that boundary 🤷‍♂️

Jul 02, 2022  6:49:48 PM
+19788578969
I’m really tryna explain this with callan but it’s not working ooof

Jul 02, 2022  6:50:16 PM

Maybe take a break and let some ideas collect and then resume

Sometimes I end up just going in circles in the moment

Jul 02, 2022  6:50:58 PM

You’re completely valid just on the fact that you’re uncomfortable

Jul 02, 2022  6:51:00 PM
+19788578969
That’s what I told him we’re just going in circles haha

Jul 02, 2022  6:51:05 PM
Me
I mean would you ever talk to Sami

Jul 02, 2022  6:51:15 PM
Me
Level with her

Jul 02, 2022  6:51:17 PM
+19788578969
Yea she knows something’s up

Jul 02, 2022  6:51:37 PM (Read by you after 1 second)
+19788578969
bc some friends asked me to do something and mentioned w Sami and I was like no thanks and she heard lol

Jul 02, 2022  6:52:13 PM
+19788578969
It’s awkward bc it makes them like smoking alone or going to bars alone feel weird

Jul 02, 2022  6:52:38 PM
Me
Like just callan and her go out?

Jul 02, 2022  6:52:42 PM
+19788578969
Yeee

Jul 02, 2022  6:52:49 PM

Yeeee

Jul 02, 2022  6:53:20 PM
Me
Eeesh I don’t know about you but I’d say that’s a no boundary for me

Jul 02, 2022  6:53:41 PM
Me
And definitely should be something that Sami should already be conscious of

Jul 02, 2022  6:54:12 PM
+19788578969
See so my friend haylie had a thing happen with Sami where they are no longer friends bc she said boundaries weren’t respected and Haylie lost all of her friends from home to Sami (me included)

Jul 02, 2022  6:54:15 PM (Read by you after 46 seconds)

And now I’m like ahh

Jul 02, 2022  6:54:23 PM (Read by you after 38 seconds)
+19788578969
But tbf idk if I’m crazy bc callan is not on that side

Me
Sort of sus behavior even tho I’m sure callan is oblivious

Jul 02, 2022  6:54:57 PM

Jul 02, 2022  6:55:00 PM (Read by you after 1 second)

We’ll see on discord all of Callans friends would make jokes to me privately about Sami and him being in love and me being the third wheel lol

Jul 02, 2022  6:55:02 PM
Me
Very valid concerns

Jul 02, 2022  6:55:17 PM
+19788578969
and I just wanted to be chill so I was like she can’t help who she likes etc but now I’m like

Jul 02, 2022  6:55:32 PM
Me
Oh so it started off as just clowning but now that you have concerns it’s hitting harder?

Jul 02, 2022  6:55:44 PM
+19788578969
Kinda annoyed bc the guys who would make the jokes about them are now hanging with her all the time and I’m like does anyone care

Jul 02, 2022  6:55:47 PM
+19788578969
Yes exactly

Jul 02, 2022  6:56:08 PM

Yeah I’d hope they stop if you just don’t react, or just say shut up lol

Jul 02, 2022  6:56:37 PM (Read by you after 2 seconds)

They started feeling bad and apologizing bc they’ saw it looked real

Jul 02, 2022  6:56:40 PM

But now they hang out with her

Jul 02, 2022  6:56:47 PM
+19788578969
And I’m like damn homies no support?

Jul 02, 2022  6:56:48 PM

Well yeah I guess you can’t help who someone likes but you can have space

Jul 02, 2022  6:57:20 PM

Jul 02, 2022  6:57:35 PM (Read by you after 2 seconds)
+19788578969
Yea like it’s not her fault for liking him

Jul 02, 2022  6:57:38 PM
Me
Just because the backup isn’t there doesn’t mean your wrong or crazy or anything

Jul 02, 2022  6:57:40 PM
+19788578969
But I do just want my own friend groups

Jul 02, 2022  6:57:59 PM
+19788578969
It’s really hard convincing callan it is not about me wanting a monopoly on the guys

Jul 02, 2022  6:57:59 PM
Me
So is callan inviting her to your hangouts?

Jul 02, 2022  6:58:11 PM
+19788578969
yea and now the other guys are too

Jul 02, 2022  6:58:12 PM
Me
Or is she also sort of connected to your groups

Jul 02, 2022  6:58:25 PM
+19788578969
Yes she’s become thoroughly integrated somewhat bc of callan

Jul 02, 2022  6:58:27 PM

Very frustrating

Jul 02, 2022  6:58:39 PM (Read by you after 2 seconds)

But he says it’s so long ago that she said she likes him (nivember) that it’s not real

Jul 02, 2022  6:58:44 PM
+19788578969
But I learned only recently

Jul 02, 2022  6:58:47 PM
+19788578969
And it still seems like

Jul 02, 2022  6:58:52 PM

believable

Jul 02, 2022  6:58:56 PM

I don’t know man I’d just really level with callan and just say that’s how you feel and this is the boundary

She told my friend that if it wasn’t for me she would date him

And I told callan and he said he didn’t think that was true

That’s rude

Jul 02, 2022  7:00:06 PM

Like it wasn’t the vibe he got

Jul 02, 2022  7:00:33 PM
+19788578969
At first I tried to play it cool bc she can’t control who she likes but the fact that other people are noticing is like

Jul 02, 2022  7:00:38 PM
+19788578969
tough

Jul 02, 2022  7:00:52 PM

Callan should know better not to go out with the girl who is completely sus

Jul 02, 2022  7:00:54 PM (Read by you after 1 second)
+19788578969
If I told callan that even his best friend made jokes about it like he’d be mortified

Why don’t you tell him?

Jul 02, 2022  7:01:25 PM
+19788578969
He’s really insecure about friendships

You don’t have to be mean about it or anything

Jul 02, 2022  7:01:54 PM

I’m worried if I tell him this he’s gonna think I’m too close with the guys

Jul 02, 2022  7:01:57 PM
Me
But like if someone close to him is also saying it it’ll add some clout

Jul 02, 2022  7:02:17 PM

Well you aren’t going out 1:1 with them

Jul 02, 2022  7:02:19 PM

i told him I’d literally delete all contacts with any guy if he was uncomfortable like right this instant and he said that’s not fair to the guys as a metaphor for why he wouldn’t do it to Sami

I think he’s alluding to breaking up rather than distancing from Sami and he says I don’t like losing make attention

Really?! Literally makes it so much worse that the code blue drills are so engrained

Saying he doesn’t wanna lose friends etc, it’s on me for making him do this

Putting a lot of his insecurities of not being able to make friends on me etc

Jul 03, 2022  2:08:25 PM

If he truly doesn’t understand I can get that but nobody should be going out 1:1 with your partners friend

He said Sami was like his Andrew and he doesn’t wanna lose it

Because it just makes you feel weird, and it should

Jul 03, 2022  2:08:49 PM

but he will if it’s important to me

Yea well I am very trusting so I was like whatever, but in hindsight like she bought him matching smoking stuff, would take pics with him, I just feel lied to

Jul 03, 2022  2:10:39 PM

The thing is it’s perfectly legitimate for him to want to be friends with Sami but by acting this way and putting you in this situation he’s making that harder for him

Jul 03, 2022  2:10:54 PM
+19788578969
I just feel like she was juggling tryn be genuine friends with me while also really liking him

Jul 03, 2022  2:11:19 PM
+19788578969
and it’s weird that he dismisses 3 of his friends making comments about it as them trying to annoy me

Well he shouldn’t dismiss something that is purposefully trying to annoy you

He should shut that down it’s clear it’s not cool

It’s hard bc now she’s fully integrated with like my online friends

Jul 03, 2022  2:31:46 PM
+19788578969
And I told callan I wanted separation from that but he said it was only bc I preferred the male validation to myself

Bit of a gaslight there

Jul 03, 2022  2:32:28 PM
+19788578969
like I like hanging with the guys but I only do it when two of them are there

Jul 03, 2022  2:32:32 PM (Read by you after 1 second)
+19788578969
I won’t hang out one on one

Jul 03, 2022  2:32:43 PM
+19788578969
And I think he’s jealous that I can make friends with them quicker than he can

Jul 03, 2022  2:33:41 PM
+19788578969
He said I was controlling them to not hang with Sami, but I told Parker (who has a history of being w toxic girls) that if I ever told him who he could and couldn’t hang out with to drop me as a friend so fast. Bc he even asked me if he should stop talking to Sami and I said of course not it’s your life

Jul 03, 2022  2:35:33 PM
Me
Maybe jealousy a factor but it sort of sounds like he’s trying to find some justification

Jul 03, 2022  2:35:57 PM
Me
Like if he can convince you you’re doing that than it’s not as bad

Jul 03, 2022  2:36:20 PM
Me
And like maybe you guys can totally work it out with Sami but gaslighting and being toxic doesn’t help his own case

Jul 03, 2022  2:36:52 PM
Me
It’s not like he can snap his fingers and change how you feel. It’s just making everything harder

Yea, I honestly doubt the foundation of this relationship if it keeps going to his insecurities

Jul 03, 2022  2:39:52 PM (Read by them after 1 second)

Thing is the foundation is still totally there its just the present and being considerate of each other

Jul 03, 2022  2:40:19 PM

He doesn’t want to lose friends, totally understandable. But you can’t just be hanging out all the time with totally absolutely sus friends who make your partner uncomfortable

Jul 03, 2022  2:40:45 PM (Read by you after 1 second)
+19788578969
Also I am making all of the friends for him, and then if I go off and make new friends it’s like a big no no for him too

Jul 03, 2022  2:41:28 PM
+19788578969
He was annoyed that I made a group of friends who made me happier and feel secure and he felt like he couldn’t talk to Andrew anymore apparently. Which is weird bc I still talked to Andrew and invited him over. Like callan is just blaming me for him losing friends when I’m not there to walk him through it

Jul 03, 2022  2:41:53 PM
Me
Why does he think you are costing him friends?

Jul 03, 2022  2:42:27 PM (Read by you after 39 seconds)
+19788578969
Because if I stop hanging out with them he doesn’t know how to communicate, he admired that as much that’s not me paraphrasing

Jul 03, 2022  2:42:52 PM (Read by you after 14 seconds)
+19788578969
So when I walk to go to a group that I feel isn’t toxic for me he blames me for ruining his relationship with the current group bc he can’t talk or plan well etc

Jul 03, 2022  2:43:07 PM (Read by you after 1 second)
+19788578969
He’s bringing up so much just for me asking not to hang w Sami

Jul 03, 2022  2:43:50 PM

Its not your goal for him not to have friends

Jul 03, 2022  2:43:52 PM
+19788578969
He’s just more shy

Jul 03, 2022  2:43:56 PM
+19788578969
And can’t do it without me

Thats a life challenge and its not meant to be easy

Jul 03, 2022  2:44:22 PM

But again totally separate issue from Sami

Jul 03, 2022  2:44:35 PM

If he wants to talk about the guys in your friend group it would be productive to just have a civil discussion about boundaries and what would make everyone feel better. Its not a competition for who wins its supposed to be a team effort

I just wanna chill out for a bit bc it’s weird that it seems like losing Sami is worse than me, but who knows

Jul 03, 2022  2:52:20 PM

Maybe he has an underlying assumption that he won’t lose you so its not like a what’s worse situation

Jul 03, 2022  2:58:21 PM (Read by them after 1 second)

Because the reason I think so is that Callan has talked to me a whole bunch about hanging out and learning some music and stuff when he is over here

Like franks cat was lying down preventing me from closing the bathroom door. I pushed the door sliding the cat across but it was like half way in. I kept going back and forth and it literally wouldn’t move. I go down to pick it up and it flips over and starts swatting. So I just slowly push the door closed until it lets out like a pissed off meow and runs off

So when all this went down I asked for space and then she like coerced some of my guy friends over, mainly Peyton. I talked to them separately for separate reasons: 1) to sami why it’s weird to contact my own friends when I ask for space and 2) to peyton why it’s hurtful to do that. I never wanted to control them but I made it clear I’m not going to hang with people who don’t respect me

Peyton is actually terrified of confrontation he has a fake confidence thing going on so if anything I don’t think he’s upset I think he’s extremely uncomfy. He avoids feelings like the plague. Last time he talked to his best friend parker about his feelings was when parker tried to kill himself

I worry if I’m to direct it’s gonna be rude

Lets em know how you really feel

Aug 10, 2022 10:57:22 PM
+19788578969
So I’m avoiding saying I’m mad I’m etc I’m just saying this hurt me etc

So you are mad?

Aug 10, 2022 10:58:00 PM
+19788578969
I’m really just super sad, but my default arguing is angry

Aug 10, 2022 10:58:14 PM (Read by you after 1 second)
+19788578969
I’ve conveyed so many times to him and sami they upset me and they just ignore it

Aug 10, 2022 10:58:23 PM

why do you want to keep Peyton as a friend? What do you see in him

Aug 10, 2022 10:58:29 PM
Me
You clearly are willing to fight for it

Aug 10, 2022 10:58:43 PM
+19788578969
He’s really fun to hang out with and him parker and I were a fun gaming group

Aug 10, 2022 10:58:48 PM
+19788578969
Parker and him are cousins

Aug 10, 2022 10:58:50 PM (Read by you after 1 second)
+19788578969
And live together

Aug 10, 2022 10:59:04 PM
+19788578969
Parker and I are closest and he has a lot of issues with Peyton and I want things to be okay

Aug 10, 2022 10:59:58 PM
+19788578969
i guess by proximity I want things to be okay

Aug 10, 2022 11:00:43 PM
Me
What if you just leave Sami out of it entirely. Be like “Yo Peyton, you are so much fun to hang out with and I love you bro but im honestly getting really frustrated at this whole situation, I want things to be chill but I feel like we need to be on the same page here”

Aug 10, 2022 11:00:51 PM
Me
Ya know like, tough, direct, loving

Aug 10, 2022 11:01:08 PM
Me
I don’t even think Sami needs to be a part of it you can just externalize that to just boundary violating

Aug 10, 2022 11:01:10 PM
+19788578969
See I had done that and said I wouldn’t hang out with her and wanted space

Aug 10, 2022 11:01:18 PM
+19788578969
but maybe one more chance

Aug 10, 2022 11:01:53 PM
+19788578969
i think I hold on a little annoyance for him being a shitty friend in the first place for going and befriending her, but at this point I need to let it go. I’ve said my peace to both and if they keep doing it that’s fine

Aug 10, 2022 11:02:01 PM
+19788578969
So that annoyance can make me extra upset

Aug 10, 2022 11:02:22 PM (Read by you after 1 second)
+19788578969
Like it’s frustrating hanging out with a friend and seeing them leave to hang out with the person who nearly ruined my relationship

Aug 10, 2022 11:02:28 PM
+19788578969
But I gotta get past that

Aug 10, 2022 11:02:31 PM

I definitely think the more direct and open and honest the better, concise and to the point

Aug 10, 2022 11:02:45 PM (Read by them after 1 second)

Did he know Sami at all before you explained the beef?

Aug 10, 2022 11:03:03 PM (Read by you after 1 second)
+19788578969
All they knew was making jokes saying that her and callan loved each other lol

Aug 10, 2022 11:03:12 PM
Me
Ahhh those guys

Aug 10, 2022 11:03:21 PM
+19788578969
Then they joined a call where her and callan were and vaguely got to know her but they talked about once

Aug 10, 2022 11:03:21 PM (Read by them after 1 second)
Me
Yeah I would just be like guys shut the fuck up not chill seriously

Aug 10, 2022 11:03:30 PM
+19788578969
so barely knew her

Aug 10, 2022 11:03:44 PM (Read by them after 1 second)

Every time I do that or the boys do that one or all of us end up apologizing later

Aug 10, 2022 11:04:05 PM (Read by you after 1 second)
+19788578969
And I asked her if I could have space with my own friends just to take time and she messaged them saying like tell me I’m pretty etc and parker said she was being really flirty and weird

Aug 10, 2022 11:04:10 PM
+19788578969
Peyton likes Sami btw now

Aug 10, 2022 11:04:22 PM
Me
Ahhh ok so they have known you a long time, and just recently met Sami. They knew the drama but decided to keep hanging with her

Aug 10, 2022 11:04:23 PM
+19788578969
which is why he def wants to hang with her, so I wanna respect that. Idk

Aug 10, 2022 11:04:39 PM
+19788578969
they’ve known me for quite a long time and us as a group were some of my closest pals

Aug 10, 2022 11:04:43 PM

Didn’t want to jump to any conclusions but that was the vibe from his messages

If he likes her thats just what hes going to do unfortunately

Aug 10, 2022 11:05:11 PM
+19788578969
Then they met her once or twice and I asked her to give me space, stuff went down, she added them to her server

Aug 10, 2022 11:05:28 PM

Very diabolical

Aug 10, 2022 11:05:52 PM

Its like 1 or 2 of these things seem really innocent but all together its a whole thing

+19788578969
yea

Aug 10, 2022 11:06:13 PM

Any other details?

It sucks losing a friend

Aug 10, 2022 11:07:19 PM
+19788578969
And it sucks my best friend didn’t care about boundaries

Aug 10, 2022 11:07:52 PM
+19788578969
I tried to keep my distance but it’s so sad when I’m secretly being in a call

Aug 10, 2022 11:08:08 PM (Read by them after 1 second)

Would you care if you gamed with your boys and then some other times whenever they played with her?

Separately

Aug 10, 2022 11:08:27 PM
+19788578969
See it hurts bc I’m like, weird they don’t care about boundaries

Aug 10, 2022 11:08:59 PM

Not sure hes a winner, get the major vibe hes looking to get her attention

Aug 10, 2022 11:09:48 PM
+19788578969
yea, I guess the main thing that sucks is seeing the like thing on discord where he’s playing w her and I’m like damn a friend I used to have

Aug 10, 2022 11:09:52 PM

It works pretty well

Aug 10, 2022 11:10:18 PM

i try to be honest but callan says I’m cold

Maybe you could adjust being cold into being blunt

“Peyton dude I get that you want to spend time with Sami and thats your gig which is totally chill, I just feel like you’ve been a really close friend for a while and it hurts seeing a close friend go to someone who Im having a well established issue with. Its totally up to you and do what you want just want you to know it doesn’t make me feel super secure or really happy tbh”

+19788578969
You get it

Aug 10, 2022 11:17:15 PM
+19788578969
And then when he leaves I’m like oh off to sami. It’s not that he specifically is the issue, it’s just a reminder of my best friend and then my friends who didn’t stick with me

Aug 10, 2022 11:17:17 PM
+19788578969
If that makes sense

Aug 10, 2022 11:17:37 PM (Read by you after 1 second)
+19788578969
Like I’m just reminded that people didn’t have my back. I’m reminded sami didn’t respect my ask for space. I’m reminded my friends didn’t after they knew what was going on

Aug 10, 2022 11:17:44 PM

I mean thats tough, you can just purposefully exclude him from the squad that would just be mean

Aug 10, 2022 11:17:53 PM (Read by them after 1 second)

Yeah like a trigger

Aug 10, 2022 11:18:51 PM
+19788578969
Yea I mean I don’t invite him or reach out but it’s not like he can’t join

Aug 10, 2022 11:19:03 PM
+19788578969
yea exactly like a trigger

Aug 10, 2022 11:19:14 PM

It just makes all the feelings I packed away alive again

Aug 10, 2022 11:19:28 PM (Read by you after 1 second)

Yeah I mean it suck but if other people are cool with him than you can take off and play singe player for a bit or just ride it out knowing Sami won’t be there

And the no livestreaming thing is a serious no no, like universally no no

Aug 10, 2022 11:20:18 PM

Do you think Sami might be seeking your attention?

Aug 10, 2022 11:20:48 PM

I don’t know bc I always try to see the nice in her

Aug 10, 2022 11:20:55 PM

And i don’t think of her as mean

Aug 10, 2022 11:21:06 PM

Well if hes done it twice than I think thats enough to warrant distance from him too

Aug 10, 2022 11:26:58 PM

Hmm do you think that’ll add bad vibes

Aug 10, 2022 11:27:14 PM

I guess it’s no different when they leave when someone annoying to them joins

Aug 10, 2022 11:27:22 PM

Ok say he joins

Aug 10, 2022 11:27:26 PM

So I am extremely past frank in guitar stuff and it’s become like my fav thing ever. Frank now doesn’t seem to want to play in front of anyone anymore even roommates. If play at all. Now I feel like I’m being left out of a lot of things

Sep 13, 2022  5:45:32 PM

And like I get not being happy with me taking up something he was temporarily interested in but I feel like I’m getting punished for enjoying playing guitar

But I don’t think I make it obnoxious at all and I always make sure to invite him to play and show him things I’ve learned. I almost only play in my room. I’m sure they can hear but still. I feel kind of sad not being invited to things

Sep 14, 2022  3:57:53 PM

also it’s weird I can’t really tell if he’s like just being friendly or slightly more bc he said I was the only person he can talk to about his emotions too and he said he gets nervous with everything he says to me and that he cares about me a lot but I interpret that as like not true at all bc I’m like well u did just do the entire opposite thing so you’re not exactly a top friend atm buddy

Sep 14, 2022  3:58:13 PM

You’ve never forced frank to not be the guitar guy and even tho it must be hard for him you’ve given him many opportunities and it’s on his end to step it up and practice and catch up

I was thinking about it on the way back. Probably going to say how they were both like siblings to me in a non incestuous way. Then mention about how we are in the present and a lot has changed, briefly mention and say kind words about Esther and John. Then say how I’m excited to always have K+C in my life, brief shootout to GMa and Papa Jake then end/pass

He also is insecure that I’m close friends with Peyton and he’s like do you like him bc he likes you and I’m like no I don’t want any thing like that right now but it’s also a boundary of me and we aren’t dating so you don’t get to know and he just keeps asking and expecting more

“Hope” is the thing with feathers -
That perches in the soul -
And sings the tune without the words -
And never stops - at all -

And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard -
And sore must be the storm -
That could abash the little Bird
That kept so many warm -

I’ve heard it in the chillest land -
And on the strangest Sea -
Yet - never - in Extremity,
It asked a crumb - of me.

I always thought of being with someone as slowly letting a person subconsciously become a larger and larger part of you. And when they’re gone you just find a giant hike in yourself they used to occupy. And obviously they fit that hole perfectly and it’s tempting to take them back, but they only fit that hole because they created It. It’s slow and painful but overtime you heal and realize that they weren’t the solution you needed after all

She’s the classroom head of the reflections room, which is like 5-6 kids with extreme disabilities

They created an environment where it’s impossible to succeed. She still manages to run a successful classroom at a huge personal cost. But it wasn’t enough so they are getting rid of her

Sure, I can help you with that! Here's a possible script for your presentation on the Civil War and the Sugar Act:

"Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'd like to talk to you about two important events in American history: the Civil War and the Sugar Act.

First, let's talk about the Civil War. As you all know, the Civil War was a major conflict that took place in the United States from 1861 to 1865. It was fought between the Union (also known as the North) and the Confederacy (also known as the South) over issues like slavery, states' rights, and economic policies. The Civil War was one of the deadliest wars in American history, with an estimated 620,000 soldiers and civilians losing their lives.

But why did the Civil War happen? Well, there were many factors that contributed to the outbreak of the war. One of the most important was the issue of slavery. The North and South had very different views on slavery, with the North arguing that it was morally wrong and the South arguing that it was necessary for their economy. This led to tensions between the two regions that eventually boiled over into war.

Now, let's turn our attention to the Sugar Act. The Sugar Act was a law passed by the British Parliament in 1764 that placed a tax on sugar, molasses, and other goods imported into the American colonies. The act was part of a larger effort by the British government to raise revenue from the colonies to pay for the costs of the French and Indian War.

The Sugar Act was deeply unpopular among the colonists, who felt that they were being unfairly taxed without their consent. This led to protests and boycotts of British goods, which in turn led to a series of other laws and acts that further strained the relationship between the colonies and Great Britain.

So, what do the Civil War and the Sugar Act have in common? Well, both were conflicts that arose from economic and political tensions between different regions of the United States. In the case of the Civil War, it was tensions between the North and South over issues like slavery and states' rights. In the case of the Sugar Act, it was tensions between the American colonies and Great Britain over issues like taxation and representation.

In conclusion, the Civil War and the Sugar Act are two important events in American history that tell us a lot about the tensions and conflicts that have shaped our country over the years. By learning about these events, we can better understand the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead

Title: Anakin Skywalker and the American Story

Introduction:
Good evening everyone, and thank you for coming to this presentation. Today, I want to talk about how the story of Anakin Skywalker is synonymous with the American story. At first, you might think that a fictional character from Star Wars has nothing to do with American history, but I believe that there are many similarities between Anakin's story and the American story. Let's explore these similarities together.

Body:
First, let's talk about Anakin's early life. He was born into slavery on a desert planet and was separated from his mother at a young age. Similarly, America's early history was marked by the enslavement of African people and the displacement of Native American tribes. The legacy of slavery and colonialism still affects American society today, just as Anakin's traumatic childhood influenced his later choices and actions.

Next, Anakin's story is one of ambition and the pursuit of power. He wants to be a Jedi, but also wants to save his loved ones from harm. This leads him to make choices that ultimately lead to his downfall. Similarly, America has always been a country of ambition and competition, with a strong desire for economic and military power. This has led to both great achievements and great tragedies, such as the Vietnam War and the 2008 financial crisis.

Finally, Anakin's story is one of redemption. Even after he becomes Darth Vader and does terrible things, he is able to find redemption and bring balance to the Force. Similarly, America has faced many challenges throughout its history, but has always been able to find a way to move forward and become a better society. From the Civil Rights Movement to the election of Barack Obama, there have been moments of great progress and hope.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, I believe that the story of Anakin Skywalker is indeed synonymous with the American story. Both are marked by trauma, ambition, and redemption. Both have faced great challenges and have made great progress. And both have the potential to be even greater in the future, if we continue to learn from our mistakes and work towards a better society. Thank you for listening.

Dandelions, oh dandelions,
Sprouting up in fields and lawns,
A symbol of the American dream,
Of hope and opportunity it seems.

For as the seeds take flight on the breeze,
So too do the dreams of those who believe,
That with hard work and determination,
They too can achieve their aspirations.

Like the dandelion, with roots so deep,
The American dream is rooted in belief,
That with the right amount of drive and skill,
Success is possible, despite the odds and uphill.

So let us embrace the dandelion's spirit,
And work to make our dreams a reality,
For with persistence and unwavering grit,
The American dream can be a true possibility.

Up in the sky, where the clouds reside,
A metal bird soars, with wings so wide.
It defies gravity, it breaks the rules,
It takes us places, it makes us fools.

For we are mere mortals, bound to the ground,
We watch in awe, as it makes its rounds.
It roars like thunder, it shakes the air,
It leaves us wondering, how it can dare.

To fly so high, to touch the sun,
To cross the oceans, to have such fun.
It seems so easy, so effortless,
Yet it's so confusing, so complex.

For how can a machine, made of steel and wires,
Defy the laws of nature, and reach for the skies?
How can it carry us, with such grace and speed,
And yet leave us bewildered, with so much to heed?

It's like a riddle, wrapped in a mystery,
A puzzle that defies all history.
It's a wonder of science, a marvel of art,
A symbol of human ingenuity, and a work of heart.

So let us marvel, let us wonder,
Let us ponder, and let us ponder.
For the airplane is a mystery, a thing of beauty,
A symbol of our dreams, and our curiosity.
