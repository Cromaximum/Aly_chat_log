But a car is a privilege and a very expensive privilege and I need you to act like an adult around here and not an entitled teenager. And you are old enough to know to clean up after yourself without me asking.

It is true. However, if you want the use of the car you have tonight to fix it. Otherwise it's no longer yours. I'm sorry to be harsh about this, but you've had days to handle it and you haven't, and you have been nothing but entitled about it. If you need help about what to say or ask for, I am happy to help.

Hi max. Head to BB auto after school.  You can just cut through commuter lot and he's on the other side of that road.  Park anywhere in the lot and bring keys into the left door entrance. That's the office. Laurie is really nice. They are expecting you. They are replacing the battery and wipers. I am putting money in your account to cover it. You can prob wait there while they do it. Mark the mechanic is really nice. He lives near us.

Be honest tell her your taste is more simple and in your opinion she doesn't need a super fancy dress like that because she's stunning but tell her she looks really crazy good in it.

It's not really about that, she probably felt like a princess and probably everyone at the store was raving and she prob was hoping you would feel the same. Don't even get into the materialistic part. She wants to look beautiful for you and you didn't mean to but you hurt her feelings. Just do your best to make it up to her and let her feel excited about her dress.

Hi max,
You need to electronically sign your financial aid stuff. I did all the rest for you. It's not accepting the password, no idea why. 
So go on FAFSA.ed.gov
Put in your name and social 014-83-9495 to sign in. 
It will then ask you to electronically sign and you can take it from there. 
It has to be done tonight. I've spent so much time on this so thank you for doing the last bit.

Also take a look on the island, Merrimack college sent you stuff about computer science. I want to talk to you about the option of commuting from home for a semester or year. The program looks good, you can ease into the college thing and live on campus if/when you want. And you know Krystal and Rachel. It's a small enough campus so you will be comfortable, and you know the food is good!!!!

When you get a confirmation email we can log in again and make corrections.  I was on the help line with a woman who couldn't explain where your account went so we may have to start again. I said if he doesn't have an account why are we getting emails from them and what happened to the form I mailed in? No clue. Grrrrr.

Hopefully you can see that this is not revenge, and that in the future you should respond more timely and responsibly when we are planning an event like this.

While I appreciate and expect you'd be sorry, that doesn't really cover Aly preparing for but ultimately missing the evening, a special family dinner we all were looking forward to, Kelly's pride in her work, me driving halfway to Georgetown then turning around to not miss the reservation and embarrass Kelly, the aggravation of your lack of response, etc.

No it's not, I had asked them about what is needed and they basically audit randomly so if you could just go on line and check your status that would be great. It would be awful to miss out on financial aid. 
Good about the deposit. Do you want to ask dad for his half or pay me and have him pay you back? Either is fine.

I will be there cheering you on, grumpy pants. Aly is fine with dinner and you don't have to worry about it.  It would be more helpful for you to pitch in with grocery shopping, cooking and housework if you are wanting to contribute. I check in every day about who is home for meals. 
Enjoy your last day! Hopefully you see that this is very reasonable and I don't actually ask much of you. Especially free car free insurance free phone. Those can go away. 👍❤️

And that's not even that big of a deal, I really really hate how if there is a legitimate problem we try to talk to you about you cry, get angry, go to John, or take things away. It makes taking problems to you non viable and also rarely nets results

Again, I've asked for some help with grocery shopping and problem solving. I'm always open to suggestion. I do what I think works which is frozen meals for when I'm not here or Pomodori cards and like last night asking what you all want, or asking during the day who will be home. 
It's very, very difficult without help. And I have not been good about insisting on regular diners I agree and in hindsight wished I had done better with a routine. So I will say you are right about that. I really really wish we had a schedule I could rely on and plan around. But since there is none I find myself winging it, sending unanswered texts, and all around feeling disorganized about meals. Really truly please offer suggestions.

Hi! Can you start thinking about car plans for yourself for next summer? I think it makes sense for Aly to drive the escape. Which means I may sell or trade in the focus. Unless you want to have and pay it off. The other option is to do what Kelly did which was to have me help her with a deposit and get a better car and then have a no interest loan for the rest.

Jun 29, 2016 12:45:31 PM (Read by them after 2 seconds)

No I think what Kelly did was a mistake, can you take the focus off the streets until I get back?

Effie and I are great, I have no qualms with her ever, but like 2-3 times a week she gets seriously mad at me over really petty things, like me responding to her in a group instead of directly, me helping a friend of hers with homework over text.

The problem is that you both need to find supports outside of each other. It's difficult to go to school with a boyfriend/girlfriend for this very reason.

So it all depends. If you are keeping yourself busy for lengthy amounts of time to avoid dealing with something else, that's a problem. 
If you are just very motivated and diligent that is ok. 
If you can't feel satisfied work your work and keep at it long after its done, like obsessively, you would want to look at that as problematic. 
You have to ask yourself do you have the right balance of things in your life.

So I guess from my experience in high school in 1884-88 I found that teachers were men, I didn't really feel like I could relate to what they were teaching us and I didn't have any female role models in that area. Dad of course was in programming and I felt that in no way could I do what he was doing. Which of course is true, but I guess the field seemed intimidating to me.

maybe though. Idk i like pax east, its fun, but It’ll probably be during school. A lot of it is mainstream gaming and some indie games, neither of which I am hugely involved in

Effie's angry at me again

Oct 21, 2016 10:06:52 PM

This time it's because I sent her a picture of me at the color run

Oct 21, 2016 10:07:23 PM (Read by you after 4 seconds)
+19787716952
Yeah...any chance that was insensitive?

Oct 21, 2016 10:07:55 PM
Me
I don't think so. She went home for the weekend, am I not allowed to do things?

Oct 21, 2016 10:08:59 PM
+19787716952
Of course you are. She misses doing things with you. So maybe this stung a little? Try and see it from her point of view.

Oct 21, 2016 10:09:14 PM
Me
I am trying and I understand

Oct 21, 2016 10:09:39 PM
Me
But I am tired of getting in trouble all the time. She went home, she has been invited to go for over a month

Oct 21, 2016 10:10:59 PM
+19787716952
You aren't in trouble I don't think. But just think about it, you are too stressed and overloaded to spend much time with her and she's worried about losing you, goes home to clear her head, and sees a picture of you having fun with other people.

Oct 21, 2016 10:11:22 PM
Me
I understand that point of view

Oct 21, 2016 10:11:30 PM
Me
But I always do stuff with her on the weekends

Oct 21, 2016 10:12:27 PM
Me
I work a lot, not my choice. I spend time with her also. Im tired of her breaking down over this

Oct 21, 2016 10:13:02 PM
+19787716952
I would say just try and reflect back how she may be feeling and try not to be defensive

Oct 21, 2016 10:13:09 PM
Me
Because it gets on my nerve when she breaks down all the time, gets angry at me. Especially after a long day

Oct 21, 2016 10:13:44 PM (Read by them after 1 second)
Me
Like it's not realistic, I spend time with her when I can. We aren't children

Oct 21, 2016 10:14:11 PM (Read by you after 1 second)
+19787716952
Approach it with kindness, she just misses you

Oct 21, 2016 10:14:25 PM
Me
It happens so god damn often that she literally chews me up for everything and I have never done anything to her

Oct 21, 2016 10:14:28 PM
Me
I'm trying

Oct 21, 2016 10:15:24 PM (Read by you after 1 second)
+19787716952
Ok so in these situations just see if there may be any truth or accuracy to what she is complaining about, find a middle ground.

Oct 21, 2016 10:15:53 PM (Read by you after 1 second)
+19787716952
Is there anything you could be doing better in the relationship?

Oct 21, 2016 10:16:10 PM (Read by them after 1 second)
Me
Yah I could spend more time with her

Oct 21, 2016 10:16:52 PM
Me
But you know what I like eating alone because it seems like she makes me feel like shit every meal we have together. There was one week she yelled at me every meal. So I prefer to eat alone

Oct 21, 2016 10:16:58 PM
+19787716952
Could you maybe understand a little more what it might be like for her to have you distance yourself?

Oct 21, 2016 10:17:38 PM (Read by them after 1 second)
Me
I think this all comes from her not trusting me

Oct 21, 2016 10:17:40 PM
+19787716952
Ok but is she yelling at you or just expressing her feelings?

Oct 21, 2016 10:18:15 PM (Read by you after 1 second)
+19787716952
Is it possible that you don't like uncomfortable conversations or conflict?

Oct 21, 2016 10:18:26 PM
Me
Yah I don't

Oct 21, 2016 10:18:34 PM

I don't mind dealing with it once or twice

Sending passive aggressive texts and being silent is childish

+19787716952
Max I feel like I did a poor job showing you kids how to talk our conflict and to handle tough emotions. And I feel really bad about that. But if you want to keep your relationship with Effie, you need to take it down a notch and just listen to her, and try and let go of some of this anger.

Oct 21, 2016 10:22:17 PM (Read by you after 1 second)

Oct 21, 2016 10:22:54 PM

Oct 21, 2016 10:23:22 PM (Read by you after 1 second)

It's ok! I really think she could make life better for you if you let her.

+19787716952
Max she really does

Oct 21, 2016 10:25:16 PM

It doesn't come across like that

Oct 21, 2016 10:26:04 PM
+19787716952
So can you find a better balance between school, relationship, friends, taking care of yourself?

Oct 21, 2016 10:26:24 PM

I try but I have a lot of work

Oct 21, 2016 10:26:42 PM

Like if I ever spend time with my friends she gets upset

Oct 21, 2016 10:26:54 PM

But my time with them I don't feel like a terrible person

Oct 21, 2016 10:27:55 PM (Read by you after 1 second)
+19787716952
She doesn't think you are a terrible person, she loves you. She's just scared to lose you. She is fine with you having friends but I think you need to have some devoted time to her.

Oct 21, 2016 10:28:29 PM (Read by you after 1 second)

So your room flooded last week remember I told you all the dogs were sitting on me terrified with the thunder? So we are ripping out the rug, letting it dry, and then we can figure out what flooring we should use. Probably not carpet.

hey so after break I was thinking about moving permanently to the swamp. Maybe thats a project we could do. Move the desk, clothes, etc. We found mold down here and mice poop on my bed

Hey Max, that sounds like a good idea - the desk won’t fit up there though. There would be room for bed and bureau and a small desk. We are painting today and floors being redone Monday, if you feel like helping with paint that would be great, actually I have some color options already as I was about to turn it into a guest room.

A question I have is if you are gaming late night we will all hear you upstairs, are you sure that is what you want? Walls/floors are very thin and Aly hears everything from upstairs.

+19787716952
And don’t worry about the car. Don’t bother Aly with it. We will work it out and I won’t always need my car.

Mar 22, 2017  6:47:51 PM
Me
but we should share

Mar 22, 2017  6:47:54 PM

it isn’t her car

Mar 22, 2017  6:48:52 PM (Read by you after 9 seconds)
+19787716952
Well I think there was a problem wasn’t there where I had asked you to go get it serviced and you wouldn’t? I remember saying well then it’s going to be Aly’s car.

Mar 22, 2017  6:49:19 PM
Me
why would I service the car when she is the only one using it

Mar 22, 2017  6:49:35 PM
Me
thats like asking her to service the car when I was using it

Mar 22, 2017  6:49:36 PM
+19787716952
I think I was asking you to help out

Mar 22, 2017  6:49:58 PM
+19787716952
I would hope that either of you would help with the car whenever I asked right?

Mar 22, 2017  6:50:12 PM
Me
whoever is driving the car should be responsible that sounds fair right?

Mar 22, 2017  6:50:26 PM

why should I be responsible for the miles she drives when I am 2 hours away

Mar 22, 2017  6:51:03 PM (Read by you after 5 seconds)
+19787716952
No I just needed the tires and oil done and had asked to you handle it.

Mar 22, 2017  6:51:11 PM
Me
why me? why not her

Mar 22, 2017  6:51:19 PM
Me
i had done it many times before

Mar 22, 2017  6:51:52 PM
+19787716952
Because I paid for the entire cost of the car and I would expect either of you to help when I ask. Along with car insurance etc.

Mar 22, 2017  6:52:18 PM
Me
so why did you ask me instead of her?

Mar 22, 2017  6:52:21 PM
Me
I had done it before many times

Mar 22, 2017  6:52:23 PM

more than her

+19787716952
I don’t remember I think you had time

wouldn’t it make sense to ask her

Mar 22, 2017  6:52:55 PM
+19787716952
Anyway moving forward let’s just see where you get a job and figure it out from there. You may want your own car.

Mar 22, 2017  6:53:06 PM
Me
i don’t want to own a car

Mar 22, 2017  6:53:33 PM
+19787716952
Ok we will figure it out.

Mar 22, 2017  6:53:52 PM
Me
am I wrong here? isn’t it fair that whoever is the primary user of the car is responsible?

Mar 22, 2017  6:54:01 PM
Me
you drive the car, you repair the car?

Mar 22, 2017  6:54:25 PM
Me
I drove the car for 2 years, repaired it, fueled it. Aly drives the car now, she should repair it?

Mar 22, 2017  6:54:26 PM
+19787716952
no, I own the car and I ask you both to help out. For example Aly paid the taxes for the entire year even though you will be using it.

Mar 22, 2017  6:54:37 PM

I have literally no money

Mar 22, 2017  6:54:42 PM

Ok Max don’t stress. We will figure it out.

i would have happily paid for the car in the middle of the summer

Mar 22, 2017  6:56:11 PM
Me
I had like 2 grand saved up

Mar 22, 2017  6:56:17 PM

but i spent literally every dollar on school

I didn’t choose that

+19787716952
I am very proud of you for paying for school stuff

yes but it leaves me with no money

Mar 22, 2017  6:57:08 PM

I literally cannot pay for the car if I do not have access to it so I can work

+19787716952
of course!

Mar 22, 2017  6:57:24 PM

it is selfish of aly to claim the car 100%

Me
we share it

Mar 22, 2017  6:57:36 PM

I have done more repairs on it than she has

Mar 22, 2017  6:58:19 PM (Read by you after 4 seconds)

Ok. - I am getting pressure from both sides here so let me think about it and let you both know what I decide

Mar 22, 2017  6:58:51 PM
Me
It is just completely unfair why she thinks she owns the car?

Mar 22, 2017  6:58:53 PM
Me
on what grounds

Mar 22, 2017  6:59:04 PM
Me
because she did repairs? newsflash I did that for two years

Mar 22, 2017  6:59:47 PM
Me
because she paid for a year of taxes? I wonder who paid the previous year

Mar 22, 2017  7:06:17 PM
+19787716952
I did actually!

Mar 22, 2017  7:06:29 PM
Me
yah not her

Mar 22, 2017  7:06:51 PM
Me
not to mention she makes a hell of a lot more than I did

Mar 22, 2017  7:07:15 PM
Me
she makes what like 11 an hour at winfreys? I worked the same hours for 9 dollars at mcds in newburyport. Factor in gas and their is a big difference

Mar 22, 2017  7:07:22 PM
+19787716952
Max don’t worry about it

Mar 22, 2017  7:07:36 PM
Me
i just don’t like how it seems like she is getting priority for no reason?

Mar 22, 2017  7:07:45 PM
Me
shouldn’t it be a shared vehicle because neither of us own it?

Mar 22, 2017  7:07:58 PM
Me
we share it, we split payments and repairs. One of us drives, they pay and repair

Mar 22, 2017  7:07:59 PM
Me
simple

Mar 22, 2017  7:08:35 PM
+19787716952
I will think about it and let you both know.

either way. I have a right to work full time in the summer

I’m not sure I understand, we agreed on tonight, it’s a snow storm, and over 4 hours round trip, which I have done happily many times, and continue to be willing to bring you back Tuesday morning.

hey I was thinking that it would make a lot more sense to get a more advanced weighted action keyboard, I was also thinking of switching teachers to somebody who focuses only on piano and has a more rigid teaching structure

+19787716952
So right now there isn’t really anything in the swamp because it still needs to be painted. But yeah let’s figure it out - I can understand why you wouldn’t want to be in the basement. We have the front room upstairs empty as well, which would you prefer?

Max you have missed so much drama with Michele and her farm building next door. She has started building and clearing trees but the town shut her down and told her to get a permit, and if the conservation committee finds her in violation of building near wetlands she will have to take it all down. It’s been crazy.

No you don’t have to but maybe we can create an option for you because I wanted a futon up there anyway, it will be like a music room/living room and you can use it for sleeping and hanging out as much as you want - but have the option for basement for privacy when you would like?

I just worry about her. When I'm not with her I worry because she gets upset if she doesn't see me. When I'm with her I worry about what she's thinking, or what she's upset about. Every look and action she takes worries me. She never tells me anything about what bothers her so I never know what I did or what it is which makes it worse. Just constant stress. I feel like I can't be upset because then she'll get upset and I'll feel worse

May 08, 2017  8:58:49 PM

That does sound really difficult - I think when you two had problems before it was more miscommunications. I do know that she cares about you of course and wants you to feel ok.

Hello Maximus! Could you please bring in the futon and mattress into the swamp? The mattress has a grey cover you will see. It should be easy to set up. If you could do that and find a place for it that would be great. You can keep your mattress there for the summer and use futon as a couch or we can take out the mattress. Whatever you want. Thank you!

Thomas Adès conducts Britten, Adès and Beethoven featuring pianist Emanuel Ax
Tanglewood
Koussevitzky Music Shed - Lenox, MA - View Map

BSO Artistic Partner Thomas Adès opens the Saturday, July 22 BSO program leading his own …but all shall be well, a piece inspired by lines from T.S. Eliot's quotation of Julian of Norwich in Four Quartets: "Sin is Behovely, but All shall be well, and All manner of thing shall be well." The program also features Emanuel Ax in Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5, Emperor, the last and most monumental of Beethoven's concertos; as well as the dramatically expressive Sinfonia da Requiem by Benjamin Britten, a composer for whom Mr. Adès has a great affinity.

What a great morning! Are you going to be doing the lawn stuff? Finish mowing, weed raised beds, move the compost bin that is in one of them over to the side of the yard and shovel contents back into it, weed out garden by ducks and put the slate stones back in place. All of this will probably be $75, it’s a lot of work, and also yes the promised contraband which we are keeping on the down low. Let me know.

I also acknowledge that I've probably given mixed messages about what is and isn't ok. I have become more uncomfortable with the level of partying and how it seems to be more of a preoccupation of yours, and how mean, honesty, you can be at times. Others have expressed a great deal of concern about all of this. So what seemed to be a low key occasional thing has in my perception changed. I will say yes you have always cleaned up and that I probably jumped the gun on my concern this past week about it not being done. So I am sorry for that. 
Moving forward I would like to call a halt to any parties at the house and I will do better at listening to your feelings, and doing better about communicating to you.

Jul 01, 2017  2:34:56 PM

i just don’t understand the party concern thing because the last party i had was with 4 friends over a month ago

Jul 01, 2017  2:35:10 PM
Me
is this a ban on having friends over?

Jul 01, 2017  2:36:14 PM
Me
because i just had 3 friends and aly at a firepit the other night, i don’t think that constitutes a party, just having friends over

Jul 01, 2017  2:36:41 PM

and before that its just been myself and liam watching a vietnam movie ever other day or so. at most drinking 1 cider

I’m getting mixed reports on what happens when I am away, so I will go with what you are saying and believe you. I had asked you to keep things low key specifically to avoid disrupting others. And I just can’t be the parent that allows everything to happen when I’m away. So for now I won’t be going away, and if you do have friends over, no drinking or smoking can happen. How about that? And also a priority is for you to make things right with all the things you said to Kelly. And you and I can talk when you want about your feelings about me being away, and somehow comparing that to Dad, it seemed like you really wanted to throw that one in my face. Do you really feel I shouldn’t get a day or two away now and then? I’m asking you this honestly, not in a fighting way.

Jul 01, 2017  4:26:51 PM
Me
lets leave the away thing for another time. Things have always been low key. the house is always clean, my friends literally always help clean up the same night or in the morning. We never disrupt the neighbors or cause any damage.

Jul 01, 2017  4:27:33 PM
Me
i just think its unfair to be punished for something that didn’t happen

Jul 01, 2017  4:32:54 PM

you are getting mixed reports because of kelly

Jul 01, 2017  5:10:38 PM (Read by you after 1 minute, 56 seconds)
+19787716952
That may be true, although she comes from a place of genuine worry, and you still need to make things right with her. In terms of friends I would be open to allowing them over with a condition of no drinking or smoking.  This has nothing to do with Kelly, it’s me reconsidering how laid back I’ve been and how I no longer am comfortable with allowing it.

Jul 01, 2017  5:12:57 PM
Me
Ok then I'll just go someplace else

Jul 01, 2017  5:13:42 PM

I'm not "making things right with Kelly" she threw punches too but I'm sure she censored that part of the story

Look obviously you are around more than dad, but you criticize him a lot for spending time with his SO, which is exactly what you do very frequently

+19787716952
I don’t think I say anything about dad being away,  I truly am happy he is happy and he and I get along fine. I don’t understand some of his choices but we are just very different people and if you guys have good relationships with him that’s all that matters.

Jul 01, 2017  5:18:25 PM

Ok and with that in mind, him being a very different person sometimes you have a very hard time understanding aly and myself because we are like him

I think the best way to keep things peaceful around here is to make my rules more clear, I’m sorry to have blindsided you on Thursday morning, and yes you do a great job cleaning up and helping me out, so I can see how that seemed out of nowhere. So moving forward we all need to be at least civil to each other, not throwing vicious insults, just talking to each other, respecting the household, and I mean this for all of us, ok?

Jul 01, 2017  5:33:29 PM

Jul 02, 2017  7:02:52 AM (Read by you after 1 hour, 29 minutes, 56 seconds)
+19787716952
Hey max I hope you are feeling better. I think maybe being more active during the day and adding more exercise might help with anxiety - maybe put together a schedule for yourself to keep busy - obviously Im happy to give you things to do but ideally you should be working full time and maybe running in am or pm, if you would like to join a gym I would by happy to support you with that. I do think you should contact Amy at the Shalin Liu and see if you can help out with at least one event. If you fill up your days with positive activities it can only help. And in terms of the car, all I require is that you talk to Kelly about things you said to her when angry and reassure her that it won’t happen again. We all do and say things we shouldn’t when upset and this is just an important thing for you to take care of. And when you are upset, remember to only address the current issue, it is so destructive to turn things into a character assassination or to bring up other unrelated things. That does not help to resolve conflict, which you pointed out last night causes you stress. If you want to go for a walk later today to talk (or any time) let me know.

I'm not going to get into a dispute what did or didn't happen last week. 
Moving forward there will be no partying at the house. 
Your primary focus right now needs to be addressing your anxiety, learning new ways to address people when you are angry, to get a full time job and/or internship, and have a productive summer. No more discussion. You already know what you need to do to get car privilege back. 
This should be plenty clear and I'm signing off. I will be home tonight.

I want your thoughts on how to grow grass in the chicken area. I wonder if that is at all possible.  Also I need as much of the shavings piled on the ground back there wheel barreled to the way way back and dump behind the fence. That will take a while prob. $$
Also need the pool that I emptied and it's on the yard to be cleaned and scrubbed. Use dish soap and I think there is a scrubber in the mud room sink. It's not working for the ducks it is too big.

Hi Max! I have no problem with you relaxing this summer, but I also don’t want much more time to go by without some kind of income or activity - can you focus on that today and let me know what you will be doing? I’m not sure Paul can be counted on right now...and like I said before, if you end up interning I will provide you with a stipend when you go back to school. And thank you for getting Kelly and all of your help around the house!

Max forget the floor, it is actually nice and clean. When you are up I need you to go to Amesbury to pick up an industrial size dehumidifier. The basement is a mess and it’s so moldy, we need to run that and I probably need someone to rip out the walls. We will need to empty it out so whatever else is yours down there we will figure it out.

I do have empathy for that and I know it's hard. It's tough though if it becomes a habit like you can't smoke some places and i know it does impact other family members. When do you see Teresa?

So seriously Max let me know about the trip, I would love to have you come, I can also switch the ticket and see who else would want to go. Totally up to you, but if it’s just for the plane (which is a bummer, Steve and Kathy are actually really neat people and Kentucky is beautiful), then probably you shouldn’t go. Let me know.

Yo mom I know you don't agree with me a lot but at least my sense of morality is still in line with yours. You need to stop yelling constantly at your malnourished, over stressed, anxious, and depressed daughter. Yes we left lights on and food trays out, all my stuff and not world ending either. You may not understand aly but at least treat her like a human being. You wouldn't believe how outlandishly depressing some texts I get from aly are. Aly literally doesn't eat for entire days, is often on 2 hours of sleep, and is afraid to go near you. Get me in trouble instead for gods sake leave aly alone

Papa Jake is having surgery today probably around 3 but we will go to the hospital around 11:30. He will stay there for the night and then if he is feeling up for it he will go back to Woods Hole and they will have a visiting nurse check on him there. He was in good spirits last night and hopefully all will go well today, I will keep you in the loop. So glad you enjoyed sailing!

This song is called For A Dancer. It not only inspired me for fiddling but was really moving for me when I was pregnant with you and they did some tests where the detected some probability of birth defects. I had so have some extra tests. Of course you were born healthy and all those worries were gone, but during the time between the tests and results that you were ok, I listened to this song and the lyrics “don’t let the uncertainty bring you down, go on and sing a joyful song”. I was very scared and that lyric helped me stay calm and accept whatever the results were, you were my child and it would be ok. I don’t think I actually talked about that with anyone. It was a tough few days for me.

You are putting me in a very unfair situation as I’ve told you and dad that Erin is hosting dinner.

It’s unfair to Erin who has planned this, to the cousins who are expecting to see you, and super excited. I’m sorry Max.

You are welcome to invite Dad over to watch the game here, but getting back from Foxboro after a game takes hours, trust me on that. I know how much you want to go, so plan ahead with Dad and pick another day that doesn’t interfere with family plans which have been in place for quite a while. It would be so disrespectful and would make especially my parents and Thomas so sad if you were late/missed it. I’m sure there will be other games to go to where you won’t have the pressure to get home impossibly early.

OK Max, believe me, I love seeing you and Dad having fun together, I would even be happy to maybe get you both tickets to another game and you can surprise him as a Christmas gift, maybe we can look into that? I really appreciate your understanding here. And you can spend all of Christmas with him as I don’t think anyone will be coming here, due to the weather. Maybe invite Dad and some of your friends over tomorrow for the game, I will clear out and you guys can have Bud Light and whatever!

Hello! I’m off to work. If you want to make money today you can clean the mud room and take apart the cage. You can also shovel out the coop (leave shavings in a pile by the fence) and put a new bag of shavings in there. Get the snow out of the kiddie/duck pool and fill up. I will pay you well for these things because I really don’t feel like doing them! See you later tonight.

Hello! I know you probably need to be making money before you go back to school, which is in about a week. Tomorrow is meant to rain so today would be a great day to do the coop. You can also add the dishes, keeping the de-humidifier going in the basement, and clean mud room. For a bonus, if it’s alright with you, move the green chair from your room up to my spare room and take the cube book shelf near the living room table for you. Like I said I don’t want to do any of this so I will pay you well. Oh also if you drop Aly at work and pick her up you would have the car to get groceries. Let me know how it goes with these things. I can always come up with more if you would like!

Haha, as much as I totally understand you are unhappy now, I would really think about how you can survive until the end of the semester, it may not be the most fun but I think it could be a mistake for a lot of reasons to leave mid semester, the $ lost being a big part of that. I can see if there was a medical emergency or some other reason you had to leave...not to minimize how you are feeling right now. You have a break coming up and spring goes by fast.

Idk I'd have to think about it considering I'm leaving in October for something totally different. Planning on coming back to that field tho

+19787716952
If you are planning on that, it would be a great thing for your resume. I would be willing to give you a stipend as I would rather have you doing that than working at Dunks or something. It would be a better use of your time.

Hey Max, the girls have recently suggested that we relocate to Rockport which is something I had planned to do in about 4 years. They have expressed a desire to be out of Georgetown and by the beaches and fun things to do in Rockport, and oddly enough I have found a 5 bedroom home that potentially could give you and Aly the 3rd floor for yourselves and the rest of the house for me and John, and guest rooms (Kelly/Chan) and a room for his daughter. I know it’s a lot to think about. I was surprised about Aly’s enthusiasm but she is eager to move. I just wanted you in the loop. It’s not likely to happen right away and I do want input from all of you and would love to hear your thoughts.

Hello! your card arrived although it has my name on it, same thing happened with Kelly’s card. I think it makes sense now for you to have a separate bank account and then keep that card for emergencies if you need me to transfer money. That is what Kelly is now doing.

Chandler was at a party in Salem and a guy went after him and beat him up - hit him in the back of the head about 20 times. It was totally random, he doesn’t know the guy. He made it back to his apartment and Kelly had me pick him up and bring him back here - he is doing a lot better today, I really hope it’s not a concussion. He hurt his hand as well and some scrapes. It was very scary.

Also, Gma and PJake put in an offer on the Rockport house and it was accepted. This is very good news for them, so they can live on a first floor home with ocean views and me to take care of them. I understand you will be a junior and sort of moving on with life. And I will help you with that totally. But I want you to know that you will have your own room even if it’s just to visit, or to keep your stuff, in the new house. We will keep Georgetown at least until the end of the summer. I will do my best to make the transition as easy as I can for everyone.

I have been going through the lyrics and I do think it’s a very good description of the numbness that depression causes, I was reading the back story and it’s tragic, he describes hopelessness very well. I am eager to hear how it resonates with you.

And I'm always where the
Sun don't shine, the
Tears don't show, won't
Hurt me now 'cause
Heart's been broke, I
Hate myself but
It won't show, I
Constantly lose all
My remorse, and it's
Ten for the wolf and
Three for the shepherd and it's
One for the sheep who
Led by a leopard, often
Gave his perception as a
Handle of weapon, took a
Bite of your apple, give me
All you can offer, now I'm
Trapped in a changing maze
Setting my soul ablaze
Couldn't control the pace
Where is this going? Hey
Heartless is recklessness, it is
Word of a pacifist to the
Word of a masochist, I'm
Off of the map, my Lord I
Spoke to a baphomet, he
Said he would save me if I
Gave him one thing he needed
What is this thing I pleaded?
Boy, it's the key to even
Yeah

And as I spoke my fangs were shown
Taking aback the smiles, and tells me
What you crave will soon be yours
But what I crave is already mine

Good morning Max! I filled up the next few days of your pill box it’s on the island. Also, Uncle John took Papa Jake’s old record player and has it for you, it needs some fixing up if that is something you both feel like doing. I found another Debussy record for ya it’s in the car.  If the record player isn’t salvageable we can look into getting you a new one, if you are still into it.

What would convince me that you are on the right track is getting care through the health center - meeting with the team there and showing me/us you are committed to taking care of yourself. These are the steps needed before I agree to a Germany trip. Hearing many times that your plan is to OD in your car is a living nightmare for me and your family, we love you so much and want to help. I or your Dad will come get you any time. We don’t know what to do and it scares the shit out of us when we know you are down and we can’t locate you. How can we help, and what is your plan?

Hey Max! I think you guys are heading back tomorrow? Could you make time to go say hi to GMa and move a few boxes of yours to that attic? And I would love to see you before you go! I do have the Kelly Girls here for a rehearsal a noon and visiting mom in the morning so just come when you can - give me advanced notice I can have pizza and sub or whatever here for you.

Paranoid Personality Disorder
WebMD explains paranoid personality disorder (PPD), a mental health condition marked primarily by distrust of others.

That is interesting - a personality disorder is a very extreme thing to be diagnosed with and usually goes along with someone really not functioning in society - it looks like you may recognize some traits in the diagnosis and have felt paranoid and untrusting at times but do you think it characterizes how you function every day, as in a pattern of how your relationships work?

Hey Max we have an option to get Aly into a re-let in July at your place and keep you where you are. Would you like to stay in Amherst until September, with Aly in your building as well? Then she would get a lease in the one bedroom starting in September. Gives you some more time there, if you want.

Of course I will leave it up to you to talk to Aly but I think it would be so good to have you around for a while. It’s not good to be that isolated, this pandemic is really making everyone tweak, even people who tend to not mind isolating

Ok that’s a good plan. Ativan usually kicks in within about 20 minutes give or take, and lasts at least 4 hours. I think you’ve probably taken it before at some point so maybe you know that already.

From Charlie Pierce in Esquire: “The entire country has been on the edge of a crack-up since the returns started rolling in on the first Tuesday of November, 2016. An actual president would have been aware of that and worked to calm a country that his election had so caught by surprise. But, at almost every turn of his presidency, this president* has worked to keep the country on edge, to disrupt the “domestic tranquillity” that is a stated purpose of the Constitution he swore to preserve and protect. Where there is hatred, he sows anger. Where there is injury, resentment. Where there is doubt, uncertainty. Where there is despair, poison. Where there is darkness, destruction. And where there is sadness, desperation. There’s something that feeds his soul in feeding the soul of the country to the flames. He has nothing else. He can’t conceive of another way to live. He belongs to another entirely different species of parasite.”

I would say it’s a mix. But when the police show up in huge numbers and form a perimeter around a protest about police brutality there’s going to be conflict

Good morning! Do you want my car this am? I just took Papa Jake to the dump. He loves it. Wondering if you wanted to earn some extra $$, we have a bunch of paint cans and other items that still need to be bagged and tossed - do you want to take your trash, that stuff and maybe him to the dump and I can pay you for your time? You will need Rockport dump bags which I have. Just an idea but either way feel free to use my car for the dump.

Ok. She let me know how depressed you have been, and I’ve known some of that but not the extent of how bad you’ve been feeling. She says you reach out when you need help and that you two have worked very well together to try and get you stabilized.

Thats not really a question but more of a summary of our call. She is hoping you will try a zoom style partial program for additional support, so would like to know your thoughts on that.

Jul 16, 2020 11:13:15 AM

I am continuing my job search and I am prepared to relocate anywhere if necessary. I would prefer to not be placed in a physical location, if I could zoom in for support groups than I am fine with that

+19787716952
Yes she wants to set you up with a specific program which is all zoom. Do you happen to know when UMass insurance stops? I would definitely like to get you on a blue cross plan (maybe get a family plan) which covers so much stuff. Once UMass coverage is up.

From Carol Esposito: Hi Mel
Miss you!  Such strange times. I totally dropped the ball on the internship/paralegal job for Max. Is he still looking?  I have three excellent contacts in N.H. I have sent his info to all 3. My niece Monique Donovan has a 30 year thriving Real Estate practice in Windham.  She is brilliant, amazing, and often hires. Her husband, my nephew, Patrick Donovan, is a Supreme Court Justice in N.H.  He knows everyone and hires interns. My old friend Landia McCaffrey is the first Woman Federal  District Court Justice in N.H.  Ditto for her. Sophia LaCortiglia, GMHS grad, Northeastern Law School grad, ‘2019, is a law researcher at NULS. 
My old friend, Emmett Lyne is a founding partner in his own huge firm in Boston. Corporate Law. 
I have a friend in Idaho with a thriving practice. 
My buddy Toby Dilworth, Groton class of 1975, (Rhino knows his dad—-Groton History teacher got 50 years!) has a ginormous practice in Portland Maine. 

Lmk if Max is still looking. Send me his resume to mailto:carolesposito57@gmail.com and I’ll recommend him to all of the above. Informational interviews are awesome too. They can hook him up with their networks. 

Lots of love, Carol❤️❤️❤️❤️

Just thinking about Granny and her hostility. Papa Jake is on a tear that I’ve done something illegal to him and doesn’t believe this is our actual house.

It’s bad planning to wait for the eventual accident. Take it from me, you have to be proactive and prevent a hip fracture or other catastrophe. I think for Granny they should present it like it’s her decision, she can chose several options, because the house is now too big to manage and her grandkids want her closer. Let her come up with some options from there...easily said than done though.

Hey there - Alicia is going to check Auggie out this weekend to make sure his foot is healed and ready for riding so potentially you could ask her about a Monday lesson. Do you mind taking his socks off tonight? It’s hard to get down there when I’m trying to corral the folks - nighttime is nutty - but I don’t want to impose if you are rushing off. So just let me know, and I do really appreciate when you are able to!

Hey Max. Was at the barn for a minute but you were on lunch break. The horses were hot and buggy. I hosed a few down but Auggie preferred to roll in the mud. I left carrots down there if you don’t mind saying hello and taking his socks off. Also when is a good time to talk to the financial planner? Monday sometime? They asked me for some times. I don’t know that I necessarily need to be on the call but can set it up.

You have several college/savings accounts. I don’t have access to the grandparents one but I can get that info to you. You wouldn’t be adding to those. You have one through me and we can see if it makes sense to add to that or start your own. Approx 10k in that one

Aug 31, 2020  1:08:12 PM (Read by them after 1 second)

Ok yeah because I was looking at some mutual funds and some new algorithmic advisor accounts, would be nice to add to the 10k. Is it a savings account?

I emailed you both I would just submit your questions and then figure out another time to talk, probably just miscommunication or whatever. I think it’s a really good idea for you to start your own account which is not attached to mine, which we started when you were too young to have your own account. In terms of saving and investing I don’t know what is best for you but we will figure that out.

Their account can only be used for academics, mine is yours for whatever purpose but certainly school is good use for it, although I guess 10k doesn’t get you all that far. But it’s yours.

I appreciate you telling me about eating issues and your anxiety around the ambulance bill. Please always get medical help that you need without worry about cost. Dad and I will always fully support you getting the help you need. It is not your fault that you needed an ambulance that day. I’m so sorry it was such a traumatic day. Please always let me know how I can be supportive or what I could do better. And for the upcoming weekend, please do what you can or or able. Whatever you can do is great. But zero pressure. 🌼✌️💕

this song here is what I would call one of the greatest hip hop accomplishments. Maya Angelou speaks at the end of it, its a beautiful song about the aftermath of one of Kendrick’s friends being killed. He also sings from the perspective of a prostitute reacting to Kendrick and other rappers talking about women. The lyrics are so incredible, Kendrick was born poor as hell in Compton California. His music is such an amazing way to translate his experiences to a wider audience

How would you work with a child with this same behavior pattern

Nov 05, 2020  7:28:26 PM
+19787716952
So a narcissist does everything possible to maintain the narrative that he is the best. He will destroy all in his path to maintain that narrative. A path of self destruction and delusion

Nov 05, 2020  7:29:20 PM
+19787716952
A child with this behavior would really need to practice perspective taking and maybe empathy skills if they were able. Very basic skills in understanding the value of learning how others feel

Yes if you read his niece’s book it’s fascinating and tragic. A child shown NO love and his only value was to win, that was the only way he would get father’s approval. He was slimy and manipulative so his dad saw promise. Financially “fixed” all of his failures so Donald never experienced the feeling of failure.

He cannot give in to the storyline that he is a “loser” or he will actually cease to exist. This is narcissism.  He will become more delusional. Kind of like when OJ pretty much convinced himself he didn’t kill those people. That was before you were born but I’m sure you know the story.

SO sorry about Jeanne. It doesn’t feel like she is being appreciative of everything you’ve done for her. She seems pretty territorial and irrational and that only gets worse with age. Gma was so upset she wants Jake and Frank and you to come over any time. She forgets the pandemic plus I’m sure you wouldn’t really want to hang out at the nursing home but she really cares a lot about you and did not like what she heard! It would be nice for you and Frank to be roomies!

When trump won four years ago I worked at Rockport Middle School. I went to work the day he won. Kids and teachers were crying. Trans kids, gay kids, latino kids, terrified and looking to us for comfort and the teachers were so despondent it was a day I will never forget. Horrific. The adults had a really hard time comforting the kids.

At that time I did feel overly confident about Hilary. I guess I have learned a lot about what many Americans are really like.

A dude came in yesterday, said he had all the covid symptoms, never felt worse, could barely drive to the hospital. Then told me he has limes disease for the fifth time but also got a covid test that hasn’t come back yet

Nov 13, 2020 10:17:51 AM

so basically this moron with a pending covid test comes in, doesn’t leave because he talks to me forever and even regina about the most asinine shit, i know hes prob got some light form of dementia or something but it doesn’t help that this guy is also a huge fan of himself and pretty openly racist

It’s a normal thing sometimes to buy a case of wine if you don’t really get out much, or like with the pandemic people stock up on stuff. That being said I totally understand your job requires a lot of patience and dealing with small town silliness will get on your nerves. Absolutely. I will say it made me so proud when Regina spoke about the catalog you came up with and I’m grateful for your contribution to our little farm and the difference you’ve made for Ken and Regina. That means a lot to me, especially when you are putting up with daily frustrations.

Great story about a Jackson concert with Dad. Your Dad. We get to a concert which he did not realize was “solo acoustic” and he literally wanted to die. Ask him about it. He could handle the full band shows but not solo acoustic, which I certainly understand. But I loved it. We brought Melissa with us. He went to the bar for the whole show I think!

Yes like when we went to a Dead show and he wore an ACDC shirt and was yelling at hippies to get a job. He thought that was hilarious. Or maybe Guns and Roses I can’t remember.

When I was pregnant with you some tests came back with uncertainty and I had an amniocentesis which is when they put a needle into you and get some amniotic fluid. It tests for downs syndrome or other developmental or neurological disorders. The test actually has a lot of false positives but we didn’t know that then. So the amnio was scary and had it’s own risks and there was a week or so that I had to wait to see what was going on with my baby. I listened to this song a lot. Specifically the line ” Don't let the uncertainty turn you around Go on and make a joyful sound”. It gave me a lot of comfort. I will never forget when the doctor called and said everything was fine. But at that point I had already been ok with whatever the results might have been. I’ve never talked about this but hope you don’t mind me sharing it now.

And there are lives in the balance
There are people under fire
There are children at the cannons
And there is blood on the wire

You're the color of the sky
Reflected in each store-front window pane
You're the whispering and the sighing of my tires in the rain
You're the hidden cost and the thing that's lost
In everything I do
Yeah and I'll never stop looking for you
In the sunlight and the shadows
And the faces on the avenue
That's the way love is
That's the way love is
That's the way love is
Sky, sky blue and black

the coolest part about edibles is that you can essentially make marijuana anything, brownies, butter, gummies, chocolate, condiments, snacks, etc

in general, half a joint is a 10mg edible ish, so you’d be getting essentially a quarter of a joint or less

The story is cute, “Letztes Jahr habe ich auf einer WG-Party einem traurigen Menschen gegenüber gesessen und wusste nicht, was ich sagen sollte - obwohl ich so gerne geholfen hätte. Für diesen Menschen hab ich am nächsten Tag „Grapefruit“ geschrieben. Ich hab beim Schreiben vor mich hingesungen und so ist ein "Lied-Gedicht" daraus geworden.”

Its honestly so weird, Juul has definitely got a massive amount of younger kids hooked, but however it is the lesser of two evils compared to cigs. But so many states have laws that make juul pods more expensive. So say a kid gets addicted to juul pods, eventually they will switch to actual cigs because its so much cheaper

Dec 05, 2020  1:30:06 PM (Read by them after 1 second)

So its like these laws make pods less accessible but also push more people into cig smoking

Well of course it wasn’t about getting people to stop smoking. Smoking for teens slowed down for a while but then ramped way back up

I asked a German friend and he said that if he vaped he’d just be doing it all the time versus smoking you actually have to go outside, its more of a process

Dec 05, 2020  1:40:46 PM
Me
which is very true, vaping can definitely be more addicting than smoking because its so easy to use all the time

Dec 05, 2020  1:41:04 PM

So its almost as if smoking can get people off vaping

I remember that every day at Uni everybody would smoke in-between classes. Was a big cultural thing, almost every time I hung out with people the main thing wed do was hand roll our own cigs

Dec 05, 2020  1:43:09 PM

but I have literally never seen anyone smoke at UMass, if you smoke people think you are gross, versus vaping is normal, almost basic

Also, by any chance do you have my acoustic guitar? Lastly, have you ever had a meatless sub from Rockport House and if not can I get you one for lunch today? There is life before the meatless, and after. 🌼 Good morning yes I’ve had my coffee.

Hey there. Wanted to run an idea by you. Next year at this time I want to plan a trip for you kids, johns kids and chandler and Callan. The whole gang. Seems like the Mexico destination with all inclusive meals/drinks and activities for all makes the most sense and seems like the only real affordable destination for that size group. Just wanted your input and not asking for a commitment now just researching. I know the beach is not your favorite place to be but maybe there would be enough fun stuff for you along with having the sibs there and who knows doctor bottle may appear. Let me know your thoughts ok?

I agree with your philosophy and for sure travel in general is better when it’s not an americanized resort, however we have 9 people and I like the idea of a resort for this trip where food is available whenever people want to eat - people can do activities or not, very easy to come and go and have it as our home base.

dude was akin to a child piano prodigy but received far less recognition than he deserved and its definitely because of his race, and his public persona as being super low-key

“For most people who are completely new to cannabis and have no tolerance to the plant’s effects, starting out with a dose of 5 mg of THC is a solid place to start. Take 5 mg, then wait 2 hours before taking another 5 mg.
Depending on the product you buy, 5 mg might seem like a very, very small piece. You might feel that seems like too small of an amount, and you may wonder whether it will be enough. The reality is that if you’re new to cannabis, there’s really no way to predict how THC edibles will affect you until you try them out. 5 mg might be too little for many people, but it’s better to do too little than too much for your first time– trust us. You can always take more to feel desired effects, but cannot take less!”

well I think you would enjoy both bottles, I recommend the Ioppa Rosé. An Italian Rosé from the  Colline Novaresi region, very tried and true wine with red fruit notes mostly and citrus then tree fruit notes int hat order. Idlewild has red fruit notes, citrus, and earthy notes in that order

Did you hear about the most recent horse at Kelly’s rescue? Racetrack to four different owners, they tracked him down at a slaughter facility and now he’s safe with them. He has been deemed dangerous and apparently not worthy of living. So they will give him his own field, run in shed, food, water, and leave him be for three weeks before they attempt to interact with him. They follow every horse they place in case something like this happens.

Hey Max how would you respond if people sent you things that trump supporters watch, just to “see their side of things”? I generally agree with understanding both sides of things but I don’t have any interest in seeing the other side of white supremacy. I just don’t need to see it. Am I being just as guilty as they are about not seeing other views? It’s not fascinating to me. It’s terrifying and disgusts me.

Oh and too make it even better, the right wing app Parler, was recently banned from IOS and Android. Basically to sum up the technical details, it was coded by somebody with the experience of a 14 year old. Every photo and video was never deleted, but only flagged as deleted. A (hilariousy epic female born gender queer) activist managed to scrape terabytes of data before the app was removed

Details and Analysis of Biden’s Tax Plan
Biden’s tax plan is estimated to raise about $3.33 trillion over the next decade on a conventional basis, and $2.78 trillion after accounting for the reduction in the size of the U.S. economy. While taxpayers in the bottom four quintiles would see an increase in after-tax incomes in 2021 primarily due to the temporary CTC expansion, by 2030 the plan would lead to lower after-tax income for all income levels.

“President-elect
Joe Biden
, according to the tax plan he released before the election, would enact
a number of policies
that would raise taxes on individuals with income above $400,000, including raising individual income, capital gains, and payroll taxes. Biden would also raise taxes on corporations by raising the
corporate income tax rate
and imposing a corporate minimum book tax.”

ok then nothing will change for her

Jan 14, 2021  9:42:17 AM

in fact it may even get better for her considering taxing people who make 400k+ will filter down to people like her

Jan 14, 2021  9:42:31 AM

in the form of stimulus checks, financial relief, social services, healthcare, etc etc etc

Jan 14, 2021  9:43:05 AM (Read by them after 1 second)

And also its not like people who make 400k are going to receive a cliff like hike in taxes, its a progressive tax income system which means that the rates get higher correlating to your income level

also when it comes to taxing the rich its all relative, the average American household income is 35,977 a year. With Federal Income Tax plus FICA you pay 5,384 a year. About 15% of your income. Jeff Bezzos paying the same amount would be about 28 billion dollars

Jan 14, 2021  9:49:11 AM (Read by them after 1 second)
Me
it sounds like a lot except consider how crippling the 5,000 is compared to bezzos still having a remaining 161 billion dollars

Jan 14, 2021  9:49:33 AM
Me
That is why income tax rates should go up with income so they reflect the relative value of an individuals income

Jan 14, 2021  9:50:07 AM
Me
said income there a lot but you get the idea haha

Jan 14, 2021  9:50:45 AM
Me
oh and for the record Bezzos ays about 1.2% tax rate

Jan 14, 2021  9:51:55 AM
Me
If he paid the exact same rate as everybody else he would still be taking a microscopic hit compared to 99% of people. But he actually pays about 15x less percentage-wise

Why does trump deserve a pardon for dragging the country through the dirt for months. I remember him calling Hillary a sore loser for conceding the day after the race, and that one had Russian interference for Trump according to Trumps own intelligence agencies. No pardon

People began to worship Q as a messiah essentially and some even thought Q was Trump himself. So when the day came and went and Trump lost their entire theory and worldview quite frankly came crashing down

I hope you slept well and I’m really glad you reached out, fortunately we have helpers around so I’m able to leave the house when needed. I think you probably hold on to so many people’s issues and it affects you so deeply that it just reached a breaking point - you are kind and sweet to the core and don’t want to let anyone down, but your friends are going through very difficult things and maybe it’s depleting you. It seems like that led to the panic attack. I also think that with recurring Effie dreams and what she put you through, you have your own unresolved trauma. Jamie contacted me last night and she thinks EMDR would be helpful. It’s an incredible non drug approach to trauma and can be done in just several sessions. It’s reprocessing traumatic events in the brain so they can basically be stored and not be terrorizing your daily life. You would see an EMDR clinician a few times and this would be in addition to continuing with Nell and Jaime.

If you are afraid of caving, then it puts you back into the trauma of feeling you have to do something when you don’t want to. The trauma continues.

+19787716952
Thanks for telling me what’s going on. I think you should let Nell and Jaime how you feel about the lack of communication - sounds like you’ve done that with Nell- and that you feel worse off. I strongly urge you to not change any meds without medical advice as you don’t want to feel worse. It’s dangerous. If you would like to have a consult with a different prescriber we should do that. Or new therapist. You have every right to have a team you are confident with and trust

Feb 06, 2021  4:21:48 PM (Read by you after 53 seconds)
+19787716952
Also do make sure you get the extra meds and let me know the cost. This is not the time to go without them.

+19787716952
I know you feel accused of not taking meds properly and that’s a shame and just not true. It was not impulsive it was what you were instructed to do. Sometimes that type of attitude can permanently damage a therapeutic relationship.

Hey Max. I just had a long talk with my former colleague Heidi Kelleher. She specializes in stress management and her style is straight forward and team approach like communication with everyone involved. She has a lot of experience with mood disorders and trauma. She feels like she can help you. My suggestion is to schedule an appointment with her and decide if you feel like she will be a good fit. I think it’s very much worth meeting (on line) with her as maybe she can come at this with a different approach to get you feeling better. She said to just call her office manager tomorrow am, say that I had talked with her and she gave you the number to set up the appointment. The number is above. They are in Andover but it’s all remote right now.

Hey Max I meant to mention one really good thing to give to our seniors is an Apple Watch maybe she already has it that's what we gave to mom and dad because they don't feel like it's an elderly device everyone has one but it has that built-in fall mechanism so that if they fall and they don't turn off the alarm then through GPS the paramedics come so if she were to fall and say no you weren't home then automatically someone would know where to send help for her it's been a great thing to have and very reassuring for us

For Orange County

Feb 19, 2021 12:08:24 PM

I am so over prepared I really hope I get it, I did my own math, census information, research, and research on their program in depth with highlighting and notes in order to know every possible thing they could ask

Me
As well as studying Orange County

Feb 19, 2021 12:09:25 PM

Like the said their goal is reduce Orange County Poverty by 25% in 4 years, so I found out that with a 9.5% poverty rate and a population of 3m that would be about 71,000 people, however that is a lower bound not considering immigration and standard population growth

Which we all know is illogical, but she no doubt lies or embellishes to the family and they are so against the idea of being the one helping out they just believe her

Sort of a funny story. I had just smoked weed, Granny starts banging on my door. I go out with her and she hands me secret court documents she is putting together for a lawsuit (eventually dismissed) against her neighbor. She then shows me in detail what she doesn’t like. This is like a dispute over the most pointless thing ever. We see the neighbor briefly and she and I duck very quickly behind the dock shed. Then while sitting on the steps she is constantly complementing herself and her ability to remain calm and political and then like talks about her resume or something and then this whole time she is stitching in things like how her neighbor “makes weird motions in his window”

It’s very difficult to take the blinders off and get involved. I’ve sacrificed quite a lot, and you kids have had to sacrifice, so that I can take care of the folks. I appreciate you kids understanding and I don’t regret what I’m doing, but it does involve making the elders your focus and it can be hard and also force you to face loss; grief every day

Feb 20, 2021  4:37:21 PM

Oh and I noticed that the entire time she was doing this she was almost entirely incoherent, and was literally ripping grass out behind her

Feb 20, 2021  4:38:04 PM

Its hard, but its the right thing to do. And when its all over, you will be at peace knowing you did your absolute best and sacrificed almost everything

Experiencing Granny While High. I can only imagine. I think she was bound to end up like that but having others around her used to temper it, now she has nothing to do but plot her next move, and let the paranoia in

I don’t know if you would want to...but the best thing to do (I started this a few years ago) is to keep a log. It really helped me see the patterns of cognitive decline for the grandparents. It was helpful to show others as well so we all could see what was going on

Oh John really cares he always asks about having you over and including you in on everything. He very much respects you and is interested in your life. \

Yeah, and maybe that’s like standard moms partner stuff but its way more than dad ever does

If he actually cared maybe he wouldn’t have gone on vacation during Christmas several times

So Aly has been studying for the LSAT and is currently scoring above 80% of everyone who takes the test. And they tell her that she isn’t being smart or thinking strategically when she says no to a tutor that’s $280/hr and then when I tell him to stop harassing Aly he like tells him I have a problem with privilege and also uses the word “we” instead of saying “Aly” who has done all the work herself while working a job for zero dollars an hour

Mar 08, 2021 12:45:00 PM
Me
He is literally such a money simp, his reality now is that money solves everything. He openly admits it is an unfair advantage which yes, kind of weird to say

Mar 08, 2021 12:45:08 PM
Me
And then hes like “what is your point exactly?”

Mar 08, 2021 12:45:17 PM (Read by them after 1 second)

I don’t think hes malicious hes just stupid

I appreciate you sticking up for Aly

Mar 08, 2021 12:46:07 PM
Me
But yeah, they heavily implied that she needs a tutor for the biggest possible advantage and its because her kids have had tutors literally their entire lives

Mar 08, 2021 12:47:36 PM (Read by them after 1 second)

And then act all high and mighty when they get into fancy expensive schools

+19787716952
I think it’s fine to offer help and advice but you kids are adults now and it’s important that you make your own decisions and find your own place in the world. It seems like you and Aly have a very broad view of the world and don’t want a free ride

Mar 08, 2021 12:48:08 PM
Me
Tell me what the fucking “we” means in that sentence, Aly is doing it all on her own there is now we

Also one thing that absolutely bothers me to no end and is a big reason I don’t go to Philly is because of their house. It is outrageous. They pretend to be all progressive while the carbon footprint of heating and cooling their house is equal to like hundreds of normal houses

Mar 08, 2021 12:55:23 PM
Me
It’s like why would he even say “we have no need for her to do it” there is no we

Does that mean He and Esther have no need for Aly to get the tutor? I guess I don’t follow. It’s a strange time of life when you become and adult and realize your parents are far from perfect and missed the mark in however many ways.

Mar 08, 2021 12:58:27 PM
Me
Yes, which is just a weird thing to say after spending a while claiming that its the smart and strategic move to get one

Mar 08, 2021 12:58:36 PM
Me
Implying that she isn’t acting smart or strategically

Mar 08, 2021 12:59:04 PM
+19787716952
Ok yes I think that’s very judgy

Mar 08, 2021 12:59:32 PM

Its just what they do, they tutor their kids there entire lives, all the poor kids work. The tutored kids get into better schools and act like they are smarter

Mar 08, 2021  1:00:04 PM (Read by them after 1 second)

Its just how they use their money to gain an unfair advantage so this was a normal suggestion for them and I think they got offended when Aly said no

Maybe being raised by granny left him lacking in some interpersonal skills, I really don’t understand how he operates. But when we talk about you kids he seems to care very much. But if his actions or lack of actions/words make you question that, he’s not doing nearly enough.

Mar 08, 2021  1:34:19 PM

I don’t know how he operates either

I just recalled this time in college where I uncharacteristically told him off and he said that moment impressed him because people don’t usually stand up to him but he wants them to. I don’t know if that helps and it’s not how our relationship ended up because I did not stand up to him usually. Anyway maybe your guilt is just because it’s not something you are used to? I think Tom does do best when you spell it all out for him directly.

Congrats and well done on your last official day at the farm stand. I agree you will prob fill in now and then. But Regina is a tough cookie and she thinks the world of you. And the family that you met who are new to Marmion came down and I got to talk to them and they are wonderful. And also sang your praises. Best of luck tomorrow and don’t forget that getting used to a new job might take time and might not be perfect at first. I’m so excited to hear how it goes. As far as using you upstairs office, come and go whenever you would like. GMa was already asking when you will be here! Enjoy your evening and you should be very proud of all of your contributions to Seaview Farm!

Thanks mom! Excited to start, will definitely be around the farm and Marmion much more often. That family that dropped in I spoke to them on my last day I believe, two young daughters? Very excited about the horses, maybe you can show that family a closer view of Auggs or Riddle

Not all bad but just very emotional and now I’m drained. I did have lovely barn time and Auggie was a very good boy. I said you are my therapy horse today so don’t bit me and he obliged.

I’m cutting back on my workload and planning with all of my clients what we will do when I need to take a leave of absence. It’s hard as we don’t know when that would be.

I don’t like crying in front of people and I knew if I met my friend Tristan as planned I would have been a mess.

London's Metropolitan Police carried out some 3,300 deployments involving firearms in 2016. They didn't fire a single shot at a suspect.

I don’t know enough about what platform you could use but your comparison of deadly force allowed by police vs the death penalty is something I’ve heard no-one talk about but they should be

Apr 20, 2021  7:24:17 PM
Me
Well certainly the police are an extension of our criminal justice system. Everybody is guaranteed due process and there are very very few crimes within specific states that have the death penalty. The police are supposed to bring suspects into the criminal justice system. They are an entry point, they shouldn’t have the authority to skip decades and decades of death row appeals

Apr 20, 2021  7:27:40 PM

When people say defund they police, it means a reallocation of police funding into social services which have been PROVEN again and again to reduce crime more than police

I apologize for not anticipating that - it was a hectic morning, Junior was up sick all night and because it was raining the driveway guys fit us in so we had no notice. Since you weren’t in the office when it got really loud I thought I could hop in there and finish that session.  I did not have my phone with me or absolutely I would have picked up I didn’t know you were here, I for sure would have just gone back into my room.

May 05, 2021  2:50:41 PM

I think the general idea is Saturday Sept 17 as the tide is high that day and that’s important for the marshes, for the 9 hours without any extension or caterer add on

Is the outside caterer fee different from what they provide?

May 05, 2021  2:51:42 PM

Are those two different services

May 05, 2021  2:52:43 PM

May 05, 2021  2:52:57 PM (Read by you after 1 second)

Yes it’s if you chose to have a different caterer, you pay that fee

Are those separate expenses

May 05, 2021  2:55:42 PM
+19787716952
They give you different bar packages ranging from cash bar to all the other things you see. Cocktail hour is the time right after the ceremony when everyone is on the deck. Then, everyone goes inside for dinner/music etc. so the beer/wine for 4.5 hours is what I’m suggesting

May 05, 2021  2:55:55 PM
Me
Ok so we pay for both

May 05, 2021  2:56:06 PM
+19787716952
So that is offered to the guests and if anyone wants to buy hard liquor at the bar they can

May 05, 2021  2:56:07 PM

yes

May 05, 2021  2:56:28 PM (Read by you after 2 seconds)

Cocktail is $15 per, dinner $35 per, Dessert $6 per

That was really fun and I enjoyed meeting Kaylin - she’s great! Hope to spend more time with you both! If it works out I will be heading to the barn tomorrow around 11:15 and I hope to take both boys out - I know you are working but if you wanted to come groom or anything let me know tomorrow.

It’s also been an enormous effort to add words from traditionally oppressed communities. For example, people frequently call black people illiterate or dumb for speaking differently. When linguists actually call it a fully fledged and complete dialect

You aren’t up yet but while it’s on my mind, since Aly is sleeping here tonight I’m going to clean up the room and hopefully her allergies will be fine, but prob best to keep Syl at home today. Dad is resting, Uncle John is spending a lot of time with him right now.

Thinking of family and recent events and between us, I kinda wish the Cape Ann Rhinelanders could come to Kelly’s wedding. I’ve seen Uncle Freddy, David, Annie, Liebe, Mary, Sandra, Freddy a bunch and we are all in touch on Facebook They are lovely. Freddy invited us to Nova Scotia. I guess Kelly doesn’t know them all that well but they are such nice people and a lovely part of your extended family.

I just got a cat carrier size large and got some good advice that if you put them in a top loading bag they're much more comfortable than trying to put them in something that opens from the side so it's got a nice zip top in the top he can even poke his head out if he wants to so I'm bringing it home now you can try it out tomorrow if it doesn't work we can always return it but I have a feeling this is going to be a good option for him

+19787716952
You are very sweet to recognize that the room is important to her. I also assumed she would be ok using the downstairs bedroom but you know this is just a really hard time for everyone she just has a hard time expressing that in a way that’s not hurtful. I would love to find a way to make it work that you still can be here during the week. I’m more than happy to set up a desk in the downstairs room if it’s not too much of a pain to move your computers? Kathy is leaving tomorrow so the room is totally free and private for you. Not ideal I’m sure but any chance this might work?

Maxie is is so hot here and the AC part needed hasn’t come in yet for your office. It may be fairly miserable up there but I am cranking AC in my room can leave doors open and give you fans if you think that is ok. If there is AC in your place you may prefer that. I do very much want to hear about what’s been going on for you.

You do have a song. We did a standard blood test and it came back questionable for some problems so I had an an injection called an amniocentesis. I had to wait a few days to see if there were some spinal cord problems or downs syndrome. I listened to For a Dancer over and over, “don’t let the uncertainty bring you down, go on and sing a joyful song” and I was sure no matter what you were my son. So of course the tests came back fine. So anyway for a dancer is your song.

If it’s too much to come as it’s already been a very overwhelming spring I totally understand, and we are going to do a very small tree planting with ashes in the fall which is what Kelly and Aly will be attending.

I don’t know why Aly is blaming you for not staying the week but she and I made the decision together that she had quality time with Gma and things were hard especially without Gatsby so it made sense to go back.

The gain basically means how much juice is going through the red box. Usually it should be at 12:00 not more. Then you control overall speaker volume with your regular volume button, if that makes sense

Really because I will set it all up for you. I think the best treatment for your stored up anxiety is actually not having to talk about it but to have relief in other ways. If you are ok with it I will book stuff for you on the weekends. I had this Reiki session with someone in Gloucester and I was a skeptic but it was actually better than any talk therapy session I had ever had.

It makes me so mad that the guy who bought him did this to him and when Auggie didn’t perform how he wanted he tossed him away. Who does that? The other brand is older and probably was from the rodeo scene out west. I will be at the barn this evening and can get some pics.

You're welcome! I'm happy he enjoyed the session. He told me he walked in a skeptic but left feeling really good about everything, which for me is awesome.

So more about the mentoring program: it consists of one 2 hr session followed by one monthly protocol & herbal consult session and three 1 hr sessions plus emailed notes for each session, emergency text and email support between sessions, and 4-6 herbal remedies throughout the month based on what he would need for support. All customized to meet him where he's at and expand his comfort zone. It is an $888/month investment. There is a minimum 6 month commitment, so we have time to really unravel and work through some of the core issues and for him to begin to experience the initial shifts in himself and his day to day life.

Although interestingly enough, Serbia was part of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire. And the Empire had so many ethnic groups oppression was rampant, so maybe justified?

So we have figured out Auggie has been losing his vision in his left eye - a cataract. The good news is it explains a lot about his erratic behavior lately and now we can adjust how we work with him. I can accept that I prob won’t be doing much riding but I love doing ground work with him. The hard thing was that it made me think of getting bad news suddenly about mom and that it was just going to get worse (this won’t kill Auggie) but startling news, and also Papa Jake was blind in his left eye and had cataracts. So I was like flooded with swirling tangled thoughts so today I have been in slow motion although I did see all the horses. Anyway wanted to tell you as you get it and I’m fine just interesting that I couldn’t tell Alicia about the coincidence about Dad having the same thing because I would have cried and I didn’t want to cry at that moment.

Thanks so much Max. That really helps. I agree riding is more a human thing. Ringo does seem to enjoy work as some horses do. Auggie is more complicated. I actually love him even more because of it. But felt more dragged down today.

+19787716952
We did decide to get a rescue horse not to ride but to save it from slaughter so what I am thinking is, some barn would think Auggie was behaving badly, throw him on a trade truck (I’ve seen this happen it’s horrific) and he has a terrible end of life. So now we know this is our job with Auggie to keep him happy healthy loved and safe. With losing sight.

So basically then they get on benefits, and are referred to agencies that help with various thing. then they can get referred to us and we connect participants with training and coaching. We also connect with the business community to try to place people

Oh also I wanted to mention that it might be worth starting to think if I can travel with you guys to the Dominican

Jul 31, 2021  7:10:12 PM
+19787716952
I was thinking about that too. I was actually thinking it might make sense to just put if off a year. I bought insurance because I wasn’t sure about covid and now they say it will spike this winter and John’s kids haven’t gotten vaccinated yet and for a variety of reasons we may be better to postpone.

Jul 31, 2021  7:10:29 PM

I tend to be an optimist that you will feel a lot better then but I wouldn’t want to put you under that kind of stress. There are many reasons I think we would all have a better time to postpone it a year.

My travel agent actually was in the Dominican last week and they are requiring covid testing and masks and it just seems like traveling is not going to be ok then.

Jul 31, 2021  7:25:45 PM

Especially with two unvaccinated people

Jul 31, 2021  7:26:03 PM
Me
Extremely dangerous to anyone around them who can’t get the vaccine

Jul 31, 2021  7:29:53 PM
+19787716952
His kids can’t come unvaccinated and they won’t let you back into the country without a covid test and you can still get it when vaccinated so what if any one of us gets it from another tourist…I just don’t feel right about it

Jul 31, 2021  7:30:32 PM

Yeah lol international traveling with two unvaccinated people isn’t the best look right now

Jul 31, 2021  7:30:51 PM

Well no they cannot come unvaccinated

Jul 31, 2021  7:31:30 PM
+19787716952
But even if we are all vaccinated we don’t know what other vacationers are or aren’t so there is a risk we could get it and not be allowed to travel back

Hey Max - I want to chat w you about food a bit more - wondering if we can add a Freshly delivery a few nights a week - I can create the account and you can select the meals that would be pre-made and delivered to your place. So you can eat them at home as you are able. Can you take a look and let me know if you would like to try it? Probably more nutritious than takeout and may add just a bit of calories/nutrition for you. You may not be up yet but can you get back to me when you are?

Well the child support one is legit I'm sure we fought a long time to end child support and for some reason me just saying I don't need it anymore wasn't enough for the courts so they probably continue to take money out of his paycheck I'm not sure they didn't they haven't been sending it to me for a long time so I I don't know maybe it was tied up with the Department of revenue no clue but I'm glad that he's getting a refund good

Hey Max so as you know I am printing out some family photos to add to the house to make it feel more like our place - I asked Aly for her favorites and over half of them were pics of you and her. I’m happy to send them to you. I hope that makes you feel a bit good. Hope you are having a good day! I’ve been so tired.

The vaccine is still extremely effective but the anti vax community is so brain dead that they’ve kept the virus going so it can mutate and beat any natural defenses they had

I will keep looking I had found some pics for you not sure what I did with them. But he was a year before me in college, grew up in Maine. Hippie parents. His mother was a social worker who really influenced me. I spent my junior summer at their place working at her agency that helped poor single moms/kids. Dad was super cool Bob Dylan guy. Made homemade pasta. Nicene loved The Rolling Stones and Elton John, he was friends with everyone. He spent time with my parents/Carlotta. No idea he was struggling. We didn’t keep in touch after I graduated and we had been broken up for quite a while. I guess things got really hard for him when he and his friends moved to Albuquerque...not sure what happened there. Came back home to Maine. I attended his funeral with a lot of the people in this photo.

Hello there! Not sure if you remember me asking you to work here Thursday because I’m going to Amherst and John is out of town but John’s mom is taking Junior so we are all set for doggy care! You are still welcome to come here any time of course but not a necessity for Thursday. Aly and I will be back around noon on Friday and then I move her into her dorm Monday morning.

It’s a symbol of courage, and was known for healing properties for a very long time. It was officially named in the late 1700s. It’s still a National symbol for Switzerland and Austria

The country that happens to be next to both of those and also borders the alps (where edelweiss grows) is Germany

Aug 23, 2021  1:34:27 PM (Read by them after 1 second)

And the tradition of courage surrounding the flower existed before Nazis. But the nazis continued the trend and there elite troops often took the journey up the alps to prove their bravery

So it’s always been pretty much the same symbol and meaning but Hitler made it feel all weird

I hear ya I actually think by the end of the day you will feel good about going, for a lot of reasons. And remember that the more you are in your body like doing physical stuff - paddling etc. the less you will be in your head. The car ride will prob be the worst part but once you are out there I think there is a good chance you might start feeling better.

Hi! Just Fyi John needed the file cabinet which was empty except for when Syl needed a nap. I have carefully put your stuff and things from top drawer into a basket on the bureau.

Yes no way to contact them but some parents were savvy. Like my friend Jen went out with a guy I guess or to a party and said she was sleeping over at my house. That was the general go-to, I’m sleeping at “whoever’s” house tonight. Then you were free to go anywhere because our parents wouldn’t check up on us. Except once when Jen’s dad was suspicious and had Jen’s younger sister call me to say goodnight to Jen and I did not know I was the alibi and said she’s not here...but I don’t think much came of it

Ok so we are I am guessing freshman in high school and Jen and I worked as counselors at Drumlin Farm. Camp counselors. So we came up with be brilliant idea to sleep over at drumlin and invite my friend Mandy (now Oscar nominated film director https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda_Micheli) but at the time my cool friend from Newton who I rode horses with and she was “punk” and we were aware of our Weston lameness. So anyway Mandy and friend show up after work is over with beer. I guess I must have told my parents I was sleeping at the farm. But I mean you CAN’T sleep over at the farm. I mean we were SOOOO dumb. But anyway we were going to have fun. So they arrive and we found a hill and started drinking the beer they brought. I had three beers which was more than I had ever had. We also had bags of fruit loops ( maybe our dinner?). So we are on this hill at the farm in the dark and I hear “Melinda, it’s time to come home” and it’s MOM. We grab our stuff and run. It’s a bit blurry but I thought Mandy was saying throw out the fruit loops but I think she meant get the fruit loops so our breath doesn’t smell like beer. But me...I grab the bag of fruit loops and throw them in a bush and say OK they are gone! Phew. We were going to make it. So we outran my parents/mom (??) and they just gave up on us. We spent the rest of the night migrating around, slept a bit in a teepee, I think maybe ended up at a local friend’s house, and were there on time for work the next day. All that happened was our boss said call your parents. She wasn’t even mad. So we did, we didn’t get in any trouble, worked the next day, no questions were asked.

Thanks Max for the little push to get the fiddle out again. I really, really enjoy our little jam sessions. And I can’t even believe we are playing my favorite all time songs. It means so much, especially to hear Dad’s piano, oh my gosh it’s wonderful. I hope some day that piano will live in your house and you can continue the tradition of having music fill the home. And your kids will be like OMG my Dad plays music from 1974...

Sounds like a challenging exit and I’m sorry for that - some people at the Triumph Center were horrible to me when I decided to leave - it was the right decision for me and like you, prob should have done it earlier but when you know it’s time to go it’s time to go. That tension is awful I hear what you are saying and it’s amazing how quickly that vanishes the day you are gone. I’m hoping the few days you have left are bearable and that life brightens up. I’m glad you are leaving. I’m happy to help with mailing the laptop or whatever else you need. Self care probably needed want a massage w Aspen later this week?

Meet Buckeye-Foster
Buckeye is a little shy at first, but warms up to you very quickly and gives you all the love and trust he has. He adores his foster sister black lab and follows foster mom from room to room. He loves belly rubs. He is wonderful with kids and adults. At this point, he is not food driven, but he loves cuddles and attention. He is still a little afraid of other dogs, especially big ones, but he is learning how to interact and make friends with them. He is getting used to big dogs and is curious about other little dogs.

He loves the outdoors and likes to run around the field or on the beach with his foster sister. His paws are as big as his foster sister lab, so probably he will be about the same size.

He is incredibly smart. He learned the walk route in 2 days. He figured out how to get around the puppy gate. He learned that foster mom will come back in 10-15 minutes after she disappears into the bathroom every night so that he does not have to scream bloody murder when she's out of si

Excellent question. There was a billboard on route 1 that had concerts listed and I think you could call ticketmaster and buy tickets over the phone...concerts were also announced over the radio. For popular concerts you would wait in line outside of record stores.

Hey there Max I'm done with my dentist appointment I have to go home and do a few things around the house but I'm pretty free after that if you want to drop the car and then go do some horse things or do some horse things and drop the car when we're done I think it probably makes sense for you to use my car until yours is ready because otherwise he's just stranded in Gloucester so anyway let me know what your day looks like what you feel like doing I think it's going to be beautiful out we could definitely take the horses out to the ring and have some fun sometime this afternoon

Ok I found the best type of job for you. Educational paraprofessional. Any college degree makes you eligible. You work with teachers to support struggling kids get through their day, either 1:1 or several kids at a time. Job can be part or full time, doesn’t have to be long term. If you can do Truimph Center you can do this! I’ve worked with many paras and your personality and skills are perfect. Pay will probably be not great. But you are done with your day at 2:30 ish, and working in schools is fun.

Hey so I’m sorting out this Dominican thing and I don’t know if anyone still wants to go, the insurance I bought for each ticket gives you 3k if you test positive so you can stay in your room have meals and fly back once the test is negative. That seems very stressful to me but so many people are traveling including our agent and she says she’s never seen a problem with anyone testing positive. But anyway as a result of changing our trip, each of you basically has travel credit to go wherever Travel Impressions has hotels which is everywhere. So if there is someplace you were hoping to go in the next year we have that. It’s so hard to plan a trip for everyone, with different work and vacation schedules. I’m sad this one won’t work out but I’m sad about a lot of things right now, right, what can you do.

What I learned was we all went to any of those three schools and we all got the same jobs so you might as well go to the one that's in the better location and more affordable the education quality in my experience was the same and each place

Whenever you feel like it, all the outside furniture that’s piled in the back yard by the back door (except those black metal chairs in the way back) need to come down to the basement and somehow stacked so they don’t take up too much room which may be impossible. Somewhere to the right of the stairs when you go down, not where the gardening stuff is.

So Thanksgiving is strange this year I guess a little bit Kelly is staying in Kentucky Aly I guess is going to dads and John doesn't have his kids on Thanksgiving day so we are going to have a meal at the Wales jar which is the little café where we had the music session this past weekend so if you would like to join John and Shirley and myself and possibly Shirley 's cousin who has Alzheimer's you are very welcome

This was my Auggie story for tonight: I’m about to leave to meet Carol and Joye, I’m wearing nice clothes for once and nice shoes, I get the call from Sue at the farm that Auggie won’t come in. She’s feeding everyone and it’s dark and he’s way back in the paddock eating hay and refuses to come in. So I say ok I’m just heading out I will come get him. Luckily I keep my tall muck boots there. I had to move the car to shine the headlights into the paddock. He was eating happy as can be on the other side of the deep muddy river. So I go over shaking a grain bucket but no go. So I traverse the mud pile and get over to him and give him a little grain. So I’ve got his attention. He starts to follow me back but it’s still quite dark and I can’t judge how deep the mud is. It was very deep. So my nice pants get muddy but we get across and he follows me. Then he pretends that he’s head shy with the halter but I was late for dinner so we didn’t play that game. Halter went on Auggie went into his stall all was well I went to dinner smelling like paddock but it was just so funny.

From Amy about working in Rockport: He would be great, as I said before. And the kids would love him. It would also give the school, teachers and admin an opportunity to see him and know how awesome he is for when something permanent, (like an aide job) opens up. It happens all the time.

I can help you with the application stuff. I definitely advise you to think about Rockport  as even if you move to Salem the driving will be so much better than Natick...128 is brutal at any time...that means less time for soccer etc. Just Mom thoughts this am but Natick would still be a great job if that’s where you decide to go

All the streets are filled with laughter and light
And the music of the season
And the merchants' windows are all bright
With the faces of the children
And the families hurrying to their homes
As the sky darkens and freezes
Will be gathering around their hearths and tables
Giving thanks for God's graces
And the birth of the rebel Jesus
And they call Him by the "Prince Of Peace"
And they call Him by "The Saviour"
And they pray to Him upon the seas
And in every bold endeavour
And they fill His churches with their pride and gold
As their faith in Him increases
But they've turned the nature that I worship in
From a temple to a robber's den
In the words of the rebel Jesus
We guard our world with locks and guns
And we guard our fine possessions
And once a year when Christmas comes
We give to our relations
And perhaps we give a little to the poor
If the generosity should seize us
But if anyone of us should interfere
In the business of why there are poor
They get the same as the rebel Jesus
But pardon me if I have seemed
To take the tone of judgement
For I've no wish to come between
This day and your enjoyment
In a life of hardship and of earthly toil
There's a need for anything that frees us
So I bid you pleasure and I bid you cheer
From a heathen and a pagan
On the side of the rebel Jesus

Beatrice was just having the best time with the toys, running around. Sil and her interacted a few times. Pretty similar to schooner. He was very unsure and then eventually just watched her on a perch for the night

Beatrice actually kept wanting to run up to Sil which definitely caught him off guard

Ummmmm yikes I don’t know...do you want to take the rapid test that I have here?

Dec 25, 2021  9:28:42 AM
Me
Sure

Dec 25, 2021  9:30:16 AM
+19787716952
Ok come over when you are ready. My understanding is that if a rapid test says positive then it’s pretty accurate, but if it’s a negative you are supposed to take it again in a day or two?

Dec 25, 2021  9:30:33 AM
Me
Or the 2 day test

Dec 25, 2021  9:30:57 AM
+19787716952
right

Dec 25, 2021  9:31:06 AM

Is she vaccinated?

So confusing what to do. So let’s do the rapid test for you and then if it’s positive the rest of us will get tested and I’m not entirely sure what we should do about going to Manchester. We will figure it out. Let me know what your thoughts are.

Dec 25, 2021  9:34:20 AM
Me
Yeah that sounds reasonable

Dec 25, 2021  9:38:57 AM
+19787716952
Can you ask her if she has symptoms? That might help to know when you would be contagious if you are positive

Dec 25, 2021  9:41:30 AM
Me
Yes she does

Did you tell Aly?

Dec 25, 2021  9:59:54 AM
+19787716952
Yes we are sort of brainstorming here what to do. She’s totally fine not too worried but agree prob you should take the rapid test followed by the two day test and we can always postpone seeing the Manchesters.

Dec 25, 2021 10:00:13 AM
+19787716952
I wouldn’t offer up the not vaccinated thing though

Dec 25, 2021 10:00:33 AM
Me
Ok

Dec 25, 2021 10:01:12 AM
Me
So if I test negative we are going?

Dec 25, 2021 10:01:16 AM
Me
Or waiting

Dec 25, 2021 10:01:29 AM
+19787716952
I feel the right thing to do is wait until you get the two day test.

Dec 25, 2021 10:02:00 AM
+19787716952
Which is totally fine nobody is freaking out or anything but it’s just so contagious why risk it when we can just wait a bit?

Dec 25, 2021 10:02:05 AM

Kelly and Chandler can still go

Hmm

Dec 25, 2021 10:03:43 AM (Read by you after 19 seconds)

Erin and John are laid back about it so you actually could still go but we would need to be more cautious because of John’s mom being 86

Dec 25, 2021 10:04:19 AM
Me
Ok how do we do that

Dec 25, 2021 10:05:17 AM

You can go up on your own and bring all the gifts if you would like, and meet up with Kelly and Chandler there.

And you guys?

Dec 25, 2021 10:05:48 AM

We would wait for the two day test just to be absolutely sure we can be around Shirley.

Dec 25, 2021 10:06:27 AM

So I should definitely wait then

If your PCR or antigen test is inconclusive or indeterminate for COVID-19, it means that a small amount of viral DNA was identified but it was not enough to test positive. Your sample will need to be collected again and retested to get accurate results.

Hey there how are you feeling? Turns out my friend at the barn has an extra rapid test that I can buy from her so I can get that a little bit later on today and she said that sometimes it takes a couple tests to actually get a result for the Oma Cron for whatever reason so I'll get that for you and drop it off but later on today probably

Kelly and Chandler left for PA this am saw them one more time and let the dogs play. Aly is sleeping, I just took Gatsby for a walk, loved it. Shirley got gifts for all of you which we have here, so nice. I’m going back to bed for a little bit hopefully to recharge!

Good morning! This is the testing info, if you want we can go together sometime this afternoon? I feel like you are fine with the two negative rapid tests but why not get the other one as well and I will too? The Curative testing site will open from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday, and from 8:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. on Saturdays. Insurance companies will be billed for testing, and those without insurance will be provided testing at no cost. Appointments are not needed and walk-ins are welcome.

Those seeking COVID-19 testing are urged to follow signage on site to locate the annex, as visitors are limited at The Open Door and will not be able to access the testing location through either The Open Door front desk entrance, administrative offices, Food Pantry or warehouses.

When facing The Open Door campus from Emerson Avenue, the annex is accessible on the left, through the glass door at the front of 26 Emerson Ave., located under an awning. Those seeking testing are asked to park along Emerson Avenue and the lane on the left side of the building.

So Melissa’s sister Alexandra is a realtor and suggests us purchasing a small condo with two bedrooms, you rent out the second room which basically pays the mortgage and then you aren’t throwing money away on rent. Just a thought.

I can get more info from her. I think it’s probably a bit much to take on right now honestly but she texted me and has sent over some listings. If you want to learn more about it we can investigate. The up side is you would own property which you could sell when you wanted. But maybe see how long you think you will be at this job.

If you and your roommate crew are thinking of all getting a place together like in Brighton or something down the road that would be the most affordable

Yeah seems a bit much. She suggested I buy it and you get a no interest loan from me. Maybe some day that would be a good idea! Not yet though, I don’t think. Property around Newton is pretty pricey

Although once Syl gets his IEP you will be legally required to give him all his modifications and movement breaks and individualized attention so that might not work well for you

There is a one bedroom condo in Salem Alexandra sent to me if you are interested, just went on the market. I am not sure what the Salem Natick commute is though. It’s affordable but not sure you want to live by yourself or if you have the roommate plan going on.

Thought - would you be ok if I got you several pasta dishes from Firing up (did you like the chicken broccoli Alfredo) and put into containers so you can have several meals set for the week? And you can supplement with any fresh salad or veggies if you want. Let me know because I was thinking of ordering from there tonight or tomorrow anyway.

So a couple food options, let me know what’s best. I can send it all over to your place tonight and you can just have it there for the week, or I can get it tomorrow and portion it out for you in smaller containers, or I can give you smaller containers to use if I do send over. Or I am overthinking it but I want to get some good meals to you to make the week easier so let me know what’s best!

Hey Max! I hope your week is going well! I’m wondering about power loss this weekend. Let’s stay in touch in case you want to come over here! We could lose power too but we’ve got the fire place...and I am sure Syl and Dory will be friends!

Jan 28, 2022  8:36:07 AM
+19787716952
We may bring Shirley over here we can’t have her with no power over there alone so my thinking is she would take the guest room and you and Syl could have John’s office and the bathroom - so sort of your own space and better if we needed to keep dogs and cat separated. You can also have the upstairs bedroom. I think it’s quite likely knowing Rust Island that you could lose power and the driving will be horrible Saturday so I’m just planning ahead.

Jan 28, 2022  5:54:10 PM (Read by you after 1 hour, 47 minutes, 20 seconds)
+19787716952
So tonight may not be horrible but will get pretty bad by 9 am...so either I would say come over tonight at any time, or very early in the morning. I’m pretty sure you will lose power and we may as well but we have the fireplace. Depending on what we do with Shirley (who can’t really go upstairs) you and Sil will have either the regular room you stay in or the office/bathroom area. So you will have your own space. Or you can have the upstairs room.

There’s one that’s become quite popular called Therapy a gecko.

A dude dresses up in a gecko suit, paints himself green, and takes live calls. He’s not a real therapist but he’s so mature, hilarious, and has a great way of developing open ended questions.

The next HUGE thing is to understand your triggers and learn how to anticipate anxiety. You want to take emergency medication before your anxiety flares up ideally. It can be a big confidence booster and safety booster to feel comfortable anticipating your anxiety. Not reacting to it

And of course basically none of this works without proper and effective communication with your local support structures

Is it worth it to be friends with someone who has an abusive partner but is so absolutely frustrating. Like we talk it out, this guy has assaulted her, degraded her to his friends, and she literally told me she counts his lies. 18 in less than a year. I stg she’s told me in 10 different conversations pretty much exactly what her friends have been trying to tell her over and over and over. Then she goes home and it’s a total lovey dovey changed my mind live in the present thing

Feb 09, 2022  8:15:45 PM

And then me and my friend who also talks to her just get frustrated at this point. Because it’s so cyclical

Feb 09, 2022  8:16:02 PM

For context my friend has an extensively abusive relationship history

Feb 09, 2022  8:16:12 PM

You can be supportive but set boundaries that you won’t participate in the abuse cycle. So if this person wants to get help of course you will be there.

It takes a long time to get out of an abusive relationship so I would hang in there but be very real about the consequences of staying

What kind of boundaries because it’s a pretty significant thing. She says she gets a ton of anxiety every day and has to randomly leave

Another tricky thing is he’s a bit of a control freak we’ve discovered. Reading texts, Snapchat history, conversations with friends. There are times it is 10000% obvious she wiped part of our conversation. Usually her own texts. She was starting to go well and pull away then they got engaged

Thinking about your friend - not sure if they would consider better help...but they do offer live chat if your friend isn’t really ready to go see someone in person...and they have “groupinars” with so many good topics that come with the subscription, this one is on Saturday: It can be so confusing to be in a relationship with unhealthy behaviors-- whether it's obvious and there's no doubt about it, or subtle and underhanded manipulative behaviors that leave you questioning if there is something unhealthy going on or not. In this Groupinar we will discuss the different tactics of manipulation, power and control someone may use in relationships, whether this is in partner, family, friend or work relationships, and ideas for what to do next.

Everything is absolutely fine but Syl seems to be having seizure problems so we are going to a neurologist sometime in the next couple weeks, scheduling today. Vet told me that everything was ok with him and he isn’t in any danger, but it will be more comfortable for him to potentially have a fairly common medication. So I am thinking that there might be a chance that the neurologist might be expensive and I might need help

Also just FYI you do a pre-screen questionnaire and ask about suicidal ideation and other things to assess if a person is in or close to being in crisis - be honest of course but just letting you know. I think it would be a great platform for you but they do screen out people who need a higher level of care.

You are very welcome and also it's totally OK to be selective about which therapist you pick we understand how the system works and that you need to find your very best match and so it's OK to meet with different ones at first nobody gets their feelings hurt it's just a really cool way of getting the ideal match between client and therapist

Hey so this may be coming out of nowhere but over the last few years I’ve really come to realize I am not a pet person whatsoever. I love Syl and he isn’t going anywhere he’s just driving me absolutely nuts and I really just want to be alone much much more. I was thinking maybe I try living in Rockport and taking a longer commute so he has more to do, explore, pets, people

Mar 06, 2022  7:36:14 PM

I just like cannot handle the nonstop need for attention I just want to be left alone

I understand your frustration of course. And you know you are always welcome here. I think Syl will do better when you have roommates and maybe another cat. We are looking at several months with heartworm treatment with Schooner and I think Aly and Callan will be taking Dory because Schooner will have to be very confined. It’s really hard but I think it’s necessary.

Mar 06, 2022  7:41:23 PM

So we can’t add Syl here right now, but I would definitely consider it once Schooner is healed.

Ok

Mar 06, 2022  7:42:10 PM

Behind the scene fun fact: The song is about a fan, according to Robert Hunter, who wrote it. A huge electric fan that the Dead had at Club Front their offices/studio in San Rafael. It had no front grill covering the blades of the fan, and when they turned it on the vibration made it slowly move across the floor. Everyone called the fan Bertha because of its size. Hunter wrote the song tongue in cheek so that it would have more than one meaning. But the fan was an electric fan and when it vibrated across the floor towards you, you had to move, move, you really had to move.

I was also thinking about Frank and what to do with a limited band member. You will waste energy hoping he will improve past his ability or motivation level. In most bands I’ve been in, we’ve had a strong guitarist or Mando or whatever for solos and then rhythm guitar. That’s what John does, he brought in Eric who is phenomenal. If you are wanting to stay on keys you will need another guitar player.

That was our last jam sesh

Mar 11, 2022 12:24:23 PM

And also he literally has been playing for almost two years, and he can’t stay in time, chord transitions are slow, strumming is basically just one down. Even when we play fast songs where you just jam he turns his guitar up to like 11 and then hardly plays

Mar 11, 2022 12:27:15 PM

Like its absolutely pulling teeth, I asked him to play literally any chord, any chord and he couldn’t do it. And if I play it slows things down more so Im just sitting at my keyboard

+19787716952
Unfortunately this is how it goes and he’s probably plateaued. It’s hard with bands and friendships. It can be really tricky. You should not waste your time or energy hoping he will be anything different than he is, I promise you. For the sake of the friendship just let it be (ahh let it be) but be honest about seeing about a lead player that maybe plays guitar and Mando or whatever. I think if Frank could do better he would. I just think he can’t.

Mar 11, 2022  2:33:51 PM

Yeah I think I might start trying to bring someone in

Mar 11, 2022  2:34:51 PM (Read by them after 2 seconds)

Its just so frustrating, like he keeps saying he wants to learn scales, notes, solos, but literally has never learned a scale, the notes, or any solos

Mar 11, 2022  2:36:08 PM

I just know its a very sensitive situation and he probably won’t play with us anymore if we get another guitar player. Even with me playing he’s not super stoked because I take the lead because he can strum like once per measure

Mar 11, 2022  2:38:29 PM (Read by them after 1 second)

But I think what pisses me off the most BY FAR is the fact that when he turns his guitar on he turn the volume so crazy high and its never the right sound like at all

+19787716952
That is completely frustrating because it's a different situation when you're just learning but now that you're getting more serious with your playing with the goal of performing that's just not gonna work very well and it is a tricky situation with friends he just doesn't seem to have the awareness of how to play in a group and that's not a natural ability for a lot of people he would really benefit from some kind of group instruction where you learn how to play with others but I can see how this isn't really exactly working out right now I mean if he could just focus on turning the guitar down and just practicing his chord changes and rhythm playing that would really be where he should focus on

Mar 11, 2022  2:42:51 PM (Read by them after 1 second)

Did I tell you about this? The summer after my freshman year at Conn College my friend Jen and I started painting this in the basement in Weston. We didn’t finish it but it remained until we literally put the house on the market 4 years ago. I lived in fear that someone would go down there and say ummm Marilyn and Jake what is your daughter up to. Mom actually loved it, thought it was beautiful. So either she or I took these pics I can’t remember, before it was painted over. Tribute to the Dead, Jackson Browne, and a lot of other stuff.

The song name indicates that, although acid takes like 45 minutes to start taking off so maybe you can do the mental math to find out what song they typically are playing then if people drop right at the start

That’s a cool system - when I used to learn solos often times I would use an app that would slow it way down and loop it and I would learn it by ear.

That's awesome Max OK so my two ideas are first I'll be playing Kelly in the bridesmaids down the aisle with my waltz another good night and you could join on acoustic guitar very easy to play we can practice it you know simple chords and that's it and so you and John would be both playing guitar with that so you get to play your sister dumb I'll which is pretty cool and then the other one would be John's band will be playing in Here Comes the Sun as a tribute to Gemma and papa jake and you could

I know that John would absolutely love to have you involved as much as you would like and I know that Kelly would just be so thrilled about it so why don't we just give it a try and come over sometime and I can show you another good night that one you'll be able to play super easily and you and John will basically be playing so kind of the same thing and then with here comes the Sun John could just show you how his band does it I guess and that's I'm sure it will be fine for you

Good morning to you! John just found out he has to have open heart surgery soon. He has to have a valve replaced. He will be in the hospital for a week and then out of work for 6 week recovery. He knew about the heart valve problem but I think is in shock right now that this has to happen soon. We cancelled our Arizona trip for my cousin’s daughter’s wedding and he is telling work today and then will prob cancel all of his summer gigs. So I said well now we will get a crate for you and schooner because they both have to be inactive for a long time. Just letting you know. He will be ok but it’s not the summer we were looking forward to of course.

Have a direct conversation with them. Say are we interested in truly making this a band and if so what are our goals. Open mic 1x week starting in May, paid gigs down the road? Regular practicing and coaching? Are people willing to do the extra work of getting lessons for their areas that need improvement. Every band does this. I used to go to various fiddle teachers to learn certain solos etc. all the time. Bring to the table the lessons you have been doing and also plan to w John. Have a real band meeting preventatively instead of waiting.

Further along with band planning if this is what you're gonna do is the discussion about who's going to purchase a PA who's going to set up the sound for the same person get more money than the rest of the band who's going to do the booking all that stuff you don't have to worry about that now but I can help you with all that stuff better iron it out in advance because band drama is no fun

AND when Will got back up from his award and played the victim and said “love makes you do crazy things” he is excusing violence because of love. That is a literal slap in the face to anyone affected by domestic violence. Its so upsetting.

Mar 28, 2022 10:44:22 AM

You know it’s extra funny because will actually open mouth laughed at the joke until jada looked at hi

Mar 28, 2022 10:44:48 AM

I hope domestic violence groups go right after him. Also it’s assault. It’s not nothing and it’s not something to be shrugged off. He set a lovely example  in a calculated way assaulting someone. We can argue if the joke was appropriate or not but it in no way should be met with violence.

18k in student loans can’t be right can it? Seems strange considering you and Tom paid every semester

Mar 28, 2022  1:52:19 PM
+19787716952
So that’s basically 2,250 per semester which does seem like it could be possible...I’ve noticed with Kelly that nobody tells you about loans they sort of just give them to you or don’t make it obvious. Like you don’t apply for them they just show up so Kelly did have to pay hers off.

I had the understanding that you and Tom split tuition?

Mar 28, 2022  1:59:46 PM
+19787716952
Yes we did. My belief is that colleges are a bit sneaky with providing loans that don’t show up with the up front tuition. Tom paid everything he was supposed to. It’s up to you if you want to ask for help with the loans but I’m pretty sure I can deal with it on my end. (Thank you gMa and pJake)!

One aspect of it was having a 104 degree fever at UMass, calling you and you answer right away at 10 pm and immediately start coming to me even saying you’re making a stop for supplies

I’m sorry that is a very difficult part of working with kids with behavioral/emotional stuff, nobody wants to restrain a child, I think I had a knot in my stomach probably the entire time I worked in a residential program for kids where restraints did happen, along with bad dreams. It’s really tough

There are ways to hold kids that are supposed to be as safe and humane as possible. It really should only be used if the child is in danger of hurting themselves or others. And then all of it needs to be really processed with the child after, with ways to de-escalate in the future

Mar 30, 2022  8:31:39 PM

You had to hold the door shut while the kid was in the room?

The neat thing about all of this is that I’m now riding Betsy’s horse, hopefully her family will give Sil the deluxe lifestyle and plenty of attention - I love that Aly was open to trying it - we have the best community. And Caroline will be working with Auggie this summer. It’s so cool. I hope this brings you some relief and I feel like if Sil goes to Betsy’s family, he stays in our barn family. You would be doing a great thing for Kathy, who is a super neat lady, some mobility issues but drives and is totally with it, and her husband, former amazing attorney, is in dementia land and rests most of the day. So Kathy would love to have Sil to talk to during the day. She is an animal person and doesn’t want/need an in your face pet, but a creature to care for. And the screened in porch! They will have a blast. Kathy is home mostly all day so they can bird watch together.

Oh definitely there will be an adjustment but they are lovely people and he will have a whole house to explore and lots of company, it’s going to be great. He got used to life over here quite well when we had him.

He’s pretty quick at adjusting, not sure. Worth trying to see what they think and get a rough idea how it might work

But whenever they’d like they can

Apr 03, 2022  7:29:26 PM

I’m assuming they have a house or significantly larger place than my apartment which he will LOVE

Apr 03, 2022  8:38:34 PM
+19787716952
They do! I’ve never been there but Kathy is a really neat person and Betsy their daughter is an incredible person. So I will let you follow up with her to make any kind of arrangements and just let me know what I can do to help. I say a trial but that’s just in the very odd case that something doesn’t go right but I know she is extremely excited about it and I’m sure it will go really well for everyone.

Apr 03, 2022  8:39:32 PM
+19787716952

She had volunteered to take Dory while Schooner has his treatments but I ended up finding doggy daycare.

Yup I’ve seen it a lot. People almost get addicted to buying all the stuff. That becomes the hobby more than learning new skills. Then you have Willie Nelson with his one beat up guitar that he never replaced. I don’t actually know if that’s true but it’s still a good example.

I’m not sure, I’m trying to play an open mic with Audrey and I offered him to play rhythm and Andrew to sing or play bass and he turned it down

If he’s unwilling to play rhythm or practice the technical skills for lead we can’t get anywhere and it’s starting to get super frustrating

Just the fact that he refused to play anything but the solo at an open mic

Just keep moving on and progressing and go to your open mics and Frank will probably sort of fade off if he’s not interested in keeping up

Apr 14, 2022  3:43:32 PM

Its so weird because its his favorite song and what he says got him into guitar, he refused to play rhythm for it because Audrey and I want to do a little guitar duet thing. But what little thing driving me nuts is if its his favorite song why hasn’t he even tried it yet

Apr 14, 2022  3:43:46 PM

If its what got him into electric guitar, his own words, why hasn’t he even approached it or asked about it

Apr 14, 2022  3:44:13 PM

The problem is we can’t, there’s 3 of us. If Andrew and I play open mics without Frank that’ll be a huge issue

Thanks for your help with cars and whatnot. Although I know John will be fine, that’s not the issue, it’s being back in the hospital basically a year from when we were there with Mom. Also, talking about anesthesia is a tough one for me as I believe that was what propelled Dad into Altzheimer’s. Or at least accelerated it. And they never warned us that with the elderly this was a risk. I actually felt really angry today when they went over that with John because they should have done that with Dad. I can’t really think “what if” but I mean what if he didn’t have to suffer that way. If he hadn’t fallen and needed surgery. Ahhhhhh. It’s so sad.

Good morning, happy Monday I hope. They ordered a part for my car at the dealership which will take between a month and 5 months to get so I need to go bring my car back. They said it was safe to drive. If you would prefer using that one instead of the Volvo that’s fine.

Hey there Max have a great day at work call me on your drive home if you want to I dropped John off for surgery this morning at 5:45 so he's probably being prepped right now and I hope to hear from the surgeon this afternoon when it's all done and I'll keep you posted I'm so glad that we could chat about medication and all those other things I have more ideas about that but I do think maybe we figured out some things yesterday which is encouraging anyway I'm also thinking about cars for you and agree that a small fuel efficient car for commuting would be ideal I am actually really loving this rental car that I'm driving I don't know what it is ha ha but anyway we'll figure out all the stuff touch base when you can

Hi that was so fun with our little group call today. Let’s do that more! So a few things. I hope your day is going well. I have more thoughts about PTSD and actually a new excellent workbook on DBT skills if you wanted to basically do your own therapy at home. Also talking to the car guy and figuring out if I should upgrade my car and you get mine, or if we find you one. When mine gets the steering system replaced it will be a pretty nice car but still an Escape, not a small car. However, if you move or start gigging and need to load the gear, that’s a plus. He’s calling me back with options. I asked for small car good gas mileage so I’m starting there.

I believe they are hopefully towing the white escape back here today. I need it tomorrow for the dump sticker and then we can swap it out and congrats it’s your new car. The service people said you can drive it but the wheel is a little creaky. When the part comes in you will just bring it over to the dealer so they can install it. There are no inexpensive options for a different car for you. So I will find myself another Escape (they have a few) this week!

I strongly encourage you to get the audio book Atomic Habits. You could get through it in just a few commutes. This is the writer I told you about who talked about not looking for motivation, but tolerating the boredom of daily routine. That is what actually helps you move forward. Here are a few quotes. I’m still looking for the one about boredom that I really liked, but this gives you an idea:

It might be worth asking around at your school if they have any incentives to send employees to get teaching degrees I know that that's kind of a common thing to do to pay for classes so maybe just see what might be available there

I tried to make something pretty simple so that you can play whatever you want over it. I basically just want to extract your melody and see what I can add to it but this can be a good reference. Also switched to A major

So can you play slowly and melodic

May 06, 2022  7:35:47 AM
+19787716952
definitely. So depending on what format you want, a typical air would have and A part and B part, both 8 bars generally both repeated

Yes

May 06, 2022  7:36:24 AM
+19787716952

It’s from the NYT. It’s a simple puzzle where you have 6 chances to guess a 5 letter word. If the letter is green it’s in the spot, yellow it’s in the word but wrong spot, and black is that letter isn’t involved

Great! So if we leave here around maybe 1 and check in to the hotel at 3, chill for a bit we can find dinner somewhere on the way and then get to Mullins at 6. Does that work for you? Are you ok just taking one car?

You are coming here before 1 and leaving your car here. We leave at 1. Stop off briefly at Lahey Burlington so that John can get his wallet which he left there during surgery. Then we go to our hotel in Gardner and check in. Time to chill for a bit and change. Head to campus. Grab food on the way. Go to Mullens Center before 6 for the Honor’s graduation. Go back to hotel. Or go out to dinner with Aly and Dad. You have the option too of getting Aly’s car before then as an option to leave early if needed. Friday - chill in hotel, you have your appointment. We have a lot of the day free so we can see what Aly wants to do or we can go for a hike or who knows. The big graduation is at 4. We do that, then go out for dinner at Pasta E Basta, then bye back to hotel and next morning go back home.

“The rare people who do become truly exceptional at something do so not because they believe they’re exceptional. On the contrary, they become amazing because they’re obsessed with improvement.

Hi there so tomorrow we have to be in Manch by noon because we have to sign some documents with bro and a notary. I think the play is at 3? So I suggest coming with your own car so you don’t have to be that early unless you want to and then you can load it up with apartment stuff (I hear they have a lot for you over at Erin’s parents house). We will head home after the play as it’s going to be way too hot to have Shirley outside (and probably John) but hopefully you guys will be able to swim if you want. That all sound ok?

Hey I am now able to see all the groups that better help offers. Have you checked this out? May be a nice way to get support through this upcoming transition with different therapists in a group format - looks like you really only sign up for one at a time so no real commitment. There are a ton of topics. Let me know what you think.

Hi! How was your first night in the new place? Did you take today off? I had a thought about the concert tomorrow and if I should offer my ticket to Rowan? John got all the tickets when at that point Rowan was going to be still in VT. I am absolutely looking forward to sharing the whole experience with you, but just wanted your take on it.

More news. Headlights and door will be fixed but it will be a few more days on your car. They did a test drive and found no problems with the transmission or engine. So I may give you the corolla for now so I can have my car back unless you think you will still be moving stuff.

I know it’s not everything but I feel like the isolation for you in college and definitely the pandemic has been harmful no no fault of your own, and me being busy with the grandparents and not as available, and all of that was probably a lot to carry. I’m really hoping that living with your friends and hopefully having a home base here in Rockport with the Kerwin/Rockwells always here for you, that maybe things will start to feel better.

Good morning! Soylent ordered. Also another idea if you want. Instacart delivers from Costco. You don’t have to have a Costco membership. Great way to just have meals on hand. Check it out. I’m about to get bulk peanut butter because Schooner is having his first heartworm injection tomorrow morning and we have to keep him inactive for literally the next 4-5 months. So I ordered a bunch of kongs and I mix up sugar free peanut butter and his food, stuff the kongs and freeze. Poor guy.

Yes I think you should look into something like the school of rock which might be in Beverly I'm not sure but they meet with you and then connect you with other talented and motivated musicians so that you can work on ensemble stuff like being a band I think that's what you would enjoy

Like I almost lost it yesterday when after over a year I still have to explain basic chords

And how to strum

Jun 29, 2022 12:12:54 PM
+19787716952
I find that very strange that Frank is not aware at all of his limitations and what it really takes to be a lead guitar player that's bizarre but you know I just think you'll be less angry if you find other band partners outside of the household

Jun 29, 2022 12:13:18 PM
Me
I think he’s very aware and he’s expressed that he feels he’s holding us back and all that

Jun 29, 2022 12:13:27 PM

And has asked if I can help him catch up

Jun 29, 2022 12:13:39 PM

But I’m so tired of the most basic things

Jun 29, 2022 12:13:46 PM
+19787716952
Yeah I think it's gonna start to affect the friendship if you if you continue to try to be the role of instructor for him I just think that that's not a good dynamic

Jun 29, 2022 12:14:07 PM
Me
He searches literally everywhere for motivation to play besides just sitting down and working

Jun 29, 2022 12:14:57 PM
+19787716952
Oh okay well it's good that he has that awareness that he needs to catch up but it's not really catching up it's really committing to learning and going through all the right steps of of learning and instrument it's that sort of a simplified game plan I think he has but I think the best scenario is to get him his own guitar teacher outside of just you guys he really needs to do that or I don't see how this is gonna work if you can't just catch up and then be on par with everybody it's always a learning evolving process as you know

Jun 29, 2022 12:17:49 PM
Me
Yeah like I have song ideas I’ve made and it’s so frustrating now that he isn’t interested in collaborating at all

Jun 29, 2022 12:18:21 PM

So then I end up trying to go over like super basic stuff and then he won’t practice

+19787716952
Yeah I don't know Max I don't I think you're gonna be banging your head against the wall to try to get something out of Frank that really is never gonna happen but there are so many amazing musicians all around that you'll be able to meet and sham with if you just kind a look and see what's out there and that will be just so much more rewarding for you

Jun 29, 2022 12:20:01 PM

Right music with friends should be fun and creative, and if it’s not, it can damage the friendship. And not good for you to feel that frustrated/angry. No reason to put yourself through that. I’m so glad you are branching out and I can’t wait to hear how the school of rock goes. I mean playing music with others always means some difference of opinions and creative direction etc. but the good should outweigh the bad by a lot.

Good morning to ya! So just wanted to let you know the deal for tonight. I’m not going to the porch concert/bonfire because I need to stay home with the dogs - Schooner can’t get his heart rate up now that he’s had his heartworm injection so if neighbors are setting off fireworks I just need to make sure he’s calm. But - John is going over of course with a reserved parking spot and so you can go over with him. It’s all close to town if you want to walk around or whatever and they start playing around 9 or so, after the parade ends. Are you bringing anyone? Plenty of room here for anyone who wants to stay over. So let me know your thoughts when you get a chance! Oh also we will all be hanging out on our porch beforehand! We all meaning John Shirley Schooner Dory and Me haha so please join!

I was able to drop off your car today. They will fix and also do oil change. Hoping it will be done tomorrow, and could you meet me at the Lynnfield marketplace after camp to switch cars? I have to go to the apple store there, so that would be a good midway point to meet up. Hoping camp is going great and also I want to hear about the night last night!

Hi Max! I’m trying to figure out the car tradeoff and also getting to the apple store. I may not be able to get there today until 4 which then puts us in traffic. That’s ok but I could get there earlier tomorrow, or depending on your plans you could come to Rockport over the weekend. Can you let me know what works best for you as soon as you can?

Next Sunday John and his music pal Larry (amazing fiddler) host a session at the Whale’s Jaw from 12-2. If you want, I will go play and you should play too. It’s a jam welcome to all musicians. It’s a great opportunity for you to play guitar and learn how to accompany trad music. You won’t be plugged in so mistakes are fine, and you can follow along with John’s chords. Sessions are really how I learned to play fiddle. It’s not a performance at all just a gathering of musicians and I know you will be able to pick up the tunes really easily. Not this weekend, July 17

John said he invited you to church tomorrow am UU church is pretty cool and I guess I’m playing - which is a big thing as I haven’t since Mom and Dad went to church with us. I’m not saying that to make you go it’s two separate things but just sharing. Today was a tough grief day for me, I really don’t know why but it felt just like a year ago.

I will tell you! Aisling introduced me and John as a booking person years before he and I got together. So John and I were friends and played gigs occasionally. Aisling was in a band called The Kelly Girls. Their fiddler left and they were auditioning people. She asked me to come out and I was hesitant as I thought I was done with performing. I met them and just loved them. Great musicians and amazing people. So I said I will sub for you as they were looking for a fiddler/singer. I’m not a singer. But the invited me back and asked me to join the band.

Jul 09, 2022  7:16:41 PM
+19787716952
So that’s what happened until the pandemic stopped all gigs. We had some conflicts about how to handle it, and at that time I was focused on taking care of the parents so I couldn’t risk anything. So we stopped playing.

Jul 09, 2022  7:18:02 PM
+19787716952
They eventually understood that social gatherings weren’t a good idea.They are starting to play again and have a sub for me.

Hey ok so just saw your request for the slowed down guitar. The tune is going through my head today I really love it. The best thing is to just download the Slo Mo app, let me know if you can find it. Then you can loop it and do all kinds of cool things.

So the plan for the car is could you please come to Melissa's house which is right next-door to Lynn's house which is probably 1520 minutes from the school on Friday after 230 or Saturday morning we're all going into Boston together and I'm gonna leave your car in her driveway with the keys and then you can just swap it out ideally anytime Friday afternoon does that work for you

The reason the car will be there is that I am going into Boston for the night and leaving my car in the driveway so really I plan on getting there at 2:30 and it will just be there with cars in it and then will be returning at some point tomorrow having breakfast at the hotel and coming back so we can stay in touch but I think getting it Friday makes the most sense probably after work

Hey Max! Hoping you are surviving yet another brutally hot day. We are headed over to Kelly’s wedding venue to talk about where the band should set up and then getting an early dinner there with Chandler’s parents, and you are welcome to join. Or welcome to come here and get your laundry done and we can see you after that. Or whatever combinations of things you would like to do, including leaving your laundry with me and getting it another time. So many options! And hey our new song rules.

Hey so at some point I want to talk to you about your car and having you actually own it. It’s what I’m doing with Aly’s car as well. It’s easy, I sign the title over to you, then you get new plates and from then on will be responsible for car insurance. I feel like it’s probably the right time for that. If you want to use my insurance agent up here in Gloucester, they are very nice and I believe do everything for you including getting your new plates. Or, you just take the title to an RMV near you. This doesn’t have to happen right away just something I would like to have happen at some point. Sound ok to you?

Smooth Automotive 86 River Street open until 7. Spoke with very nice person explained the situation. He asked that you stop by today and he will look at the car and tell you what it will need to be fixed. Could be quick fix or something else so I know you feel terrible but if you are able to stop by, this is your best bet. I looked around found a place with good reputation friendly people.

Sorry for the nuisance of all these texts there's a slight chance that a woman named Dawn who cleans our house once a week might show up but I let her know that that you would be there so my guess is she'll probably just not come and come a different day so but anyway if there's someone in the house that's what it is

Hey Max how are you feeling? Would you be available to do an airport run on Thursday mid day (I think 1:17 arrival) to scoop up Kelly and Chandler? That would help me out so much.

Hi!!!! It’s quite possible I will have all three of my kids at the same place this weekend!!! Yippie! Do you think you will be up for the Rhumb Line? Also do you think you would be able to get them from the airport on Thursday?

So my error, the airport pick up is this Friday 1:17 pm. Is that still ok? Then everyone is coming up here, hopefully Aly will be here by then. Kelly has a dress fitting at 4 and then we can all head over to Bishco in Gloucester for dinner (takeout place). So bring your laundry or whatever and you can hang with Aly and Chandler while Kelly gets her dress done, does that work for you?

Me
Yes

Aug 17, 2022 12:10:53 PM
+19787716952
Yes we don’t have dental insurance it’s actually cheaper to just pay for the cleanings and fillings and whatever. Just keep me posted and I will cover the bills. Otherwise the premiums go way up.

Aug 17, 2022 12:11:18 PM
+19787716952
Just don’t stop going to the dentist that is not a good idea.

Aug 17, 2022 12:12:11 PM
+19787716952
Do you need a new one there? Or want to keep going to the guy in Gloucester?

Ok! New one here

It’s like 500 bucks to set up would it make more sense to go to Gloucester?

Aug 17, 2022 12:35:46 PM
+19787716952
It all ends up being about the same in the long run so if it's more convenient for you to set up the new dentist go ahead and do that that's totally fine and I can pay for it but if you like the guy up in Gloucester and want to do that I just might not be as practical when you're back at work

Aug 17, 2022 12:41:55 PM

Hey Max I was thinking about how I have the anaphylactic shock reactions to some things that I'm allergic to and I was just thinking about the times that you've had trouble with your throat closing up and breathing and wonder if there's any connection?

Unfortunately that’s all psychological. I felt like my throat was at least partially closed for like a year

Yes I am totally sure and what I would like to do is go over some of your other finances together and see what stuff I should continue to pay for and what stuff you can take on yourself and I think that's some thing that we can kind of do gradually as I know it's pretty impossible to afford rent and other things as a young adult these days

I think I may have seen this before but really enjoying it now. Oddly it’s very close to the story of Dad and Carlotta, raised in Holland and leaving when very young. I do believe my great grandmother was Indonesian but I will check the Kerwin book about that. Eddie was a piano virtuoso. And did you know Carlotta was too? At a very young age she was in competitions. She burned out on it very young and never played again. We didn’t know this until she was quite old. So all those times we sat around the living room with mom and dad playing, she not once touched the piano.

Good morning and have a great day at school! Babson closes at 4:30 so hopefully you can get there before that. Do you have the $25 cash for the RMV runner? If not I’m happy to drop that off as I’m out and about today.

Sep 02, 2022  9:28:35 AM
+19787716952
New plan. Babson closes at noon today and then closed on Monday. I’m going over there before noon and will pay the runner and get your plates. You can either call in the $125 deposit, or I can pay for it and you can pay me back. I still want you to come over tonight or over the weekend to try on the tux, and we can put on the new plate. Also I have a very small surprise for you.

I’m sure it is. There is also old garden beach where I’ve often seen divers, that is where you and I walked to during that storm.

Good morning! This is my idea. Let’s keep your car appointment for Tuesday. When you pick up Kelly and Chandler on Monday and drop them here, you take my car back. I will take your car into the dealership the next day and ask for a loaner car. Then you get your car back whenever it’s done because you will be around a lot anyway because of the wedding. Let’s just get it done! How about that.

What do you know about the app Signal? Becky John’s ex believes that nuclear war is upon us and that everyone needs that app so that when the internet is down we can still communicate. Biden got those radiation pills so I guess that’s what she’s basing this on. From what I can tell, Signal seems like WhatsApp.

She’s got a group of QAnon types who share these beliefs. There would be no way she would change her thinking. Before all the Q stuff she was really into this: Alien Reptilians, who are multidimensional extraterrestrials, have been plaguing our planet for eons, lowering our vibrational frequency and using fear, manipulation, and mind-control to dominate and enslave humanity. They have no natural enemies here, so they have had free rein to carry out their agenda. But that is no longer the case The Arcturians, a much more powerful race of multidimensional extraterrestrials, are right now helping to heal the planet and raise its vibrational frequency by removing alien Reptilians and sending them to the Light. The Arcturians are highly advanced, very loving and peaceful beings from Arcturus, a star in the Bo tes Constellation. They are ready to communicate and work with any soul who aspires to journey with them to a higher level of consciousness. In their words: "The souls of the people of Mother Earth have suffered enough over the ages, and now is the time to make the Age of Aquarius a new and glorious era."

Hi! Any time at all is fine. John and I are both working - I’m done at 2, he’s done at 5. We’re both here. So make yourself at home, you can use upstairs or downstairs washing machines - We will likely be visiting Shirley at some point when John is done with work and you are welcome to join. THat’s sort of the day and come any time! I will let Schooner and Dory know!

Your passion for music along with your grasp of music theory and drive to keep learning and creating is extraordinary. I’m so glad that music is in your life. There is really no limit to what you could do with it, if you wanted.

Hi wedding participants! I'm hoping I did this right. Here is the link to the suit rental company that Kelly and Chandler used, I think they do a great job. You will see the suit that can be rented for December 23rd festivities! https://gentux.me/u8wjuk. There's a place to enter in your measurements and they make it super easy to return - they give you a prepaid bag that you just toss the stuff in and drop off at a UPS store. I think you all are going to look amazing! Nora you have "look 2" which is the vest, and the rest have "look 1".

Oct 25, 2022  4:37:57 PM
+19787716952
Hi!!! Do you still have my credit card? Please use that when ordering your suit. We are covering those costs. Hopefully you still have your measurements because the suit for Kelly’s wedding looked great on you!

Hey there Max great news they did not find any cancer in Erin's biopsy but a huge relief it's just crazy so that's what I wanted to tell you and also wanted to tell you that you still actually have money in your college fund and I was wondering if you did have outstanding loans? Which is always strange because I know that you didn't apply for any loans so so either which way you have $5500 that you can use for any classes that you might take in your future and if we want to tie up the any outstanding loans that would be a different thing anyway just get back to me whenever

If they did, and you got the 10K, you would be debt free because of the rest of your remaining college funds. I’m asking Jenna to look into it. But either way, with your college funds available, we can knock off half the debt at least.

Email them or leave a message, before we pay any money - she says we need documentation that you did actually take out the loan

Also Matt is a pro yes but he helps people put songs together and learn about the recording process and I know you would love it, and could end up with a complete song all arranged etc. that you wrote!

Hi! I saw Matt at the farmstand. He is definitely interested in having you into the studio to learn about recording, he’s working on some of Rowan’s stuff so you could check that out, and put together some of your own tracks. He loved the idea. Recording and collaborating while recording is a really interesting process, and I’ve loved doing it a lot over the years. It’s got a different feel vs jamming or writing in other ways.

You could definitely make progress, it’s a two year program wondering if you could knock off one class this spring and do a few over the summer - certainly I will help pay - you won’t be bankrupt - look into Salem State. It doesn’t matter what school you go to so look for the most affordable ones.

+19787716952
So I would suggest just doing some research and calling admissions for the Boston based schools and see what your options are. You will be accepted into any program you like but I think the biggest thing to consider is that you will have to do an internship both years which is I think three days a week. So people do balance work and school, but you just need to think about how you want that to look.

So I know you would do well. Depending on who your supervisor is, it’s quite rigorous. I was super nice to my interns but it’s a little intense with all the others. But you would crush it.

+19787716952
Yes! Thursday rehearsal is at 5:00 and dinner is at 6. Come on over here before and just head over with us. You should have gotten an email from John about the groomsmen schedule - let me know if you didn’t. That’s all the pre-wedding stuff you need to know about. One thing John and I were hoping you and Rowan would be willing to do is a toast at the reception. We would love that. Wedding is at 2, reception 3, after party at the house here at about 6:30. Of course bring guitar(s). And stay overnight I will have guest room set for you.

I happened to find a letter I think I put in a card for you when you were leaving the farmstand - here’s part of it: Hey Max!

I am so proud of you as you embark on this new phase of your life. I want to let you know how much it has meant to me to have you at Seaview farm. I was not surprised but also so pleased to hear the praise from Ken during hay season and how Regina “stole” you for the farm stand. It was so wonderful to hear about all of your regulars who enjoyed shopping but also talking to you, sometimes in German! It was really fun getting your wine suggestions and of course bringing Auggie over to visit. 

Beyond that, it was the joy of my day to bring you coffee and to hear about your latest thoughts or musical interests (I love our playlist). But the biggest joy for me was the support you gave me at each visit for what I am doing for my parents. I often started out each morning feeling down or that I should be doing more. When I talked to you, I felt so much better. I cannot emphasize enough how much you have bolstered up up during these tough times. I will say that you have been my biggest support while caretaking my parents. A coffee drop off always meant a spring in my step and increased confidence and affirmation that I am doing the right thing.

I think it’s a good idea to think about advancing your career, if you go in the fall you still have lots of time with the rugrats but you will definitely be ready before long to be doing more. Yes I would say go full time including maybe summer courses if they let you and you could get it done in close to 1.5 years, I think.

When you get a chance let’s do the research about prices and then figure out realistically what you can earn over the summers and we can come up with a budget and I will talk to the powers that be and work on setting aside the funds.

Hi there wondering if you guys are coming to the Rumbline on Saturday and I had an idea if you wanted to come up a bit early get some laundry done and we can start going through social work finances an application process and all that jazz we could do that before heading over to the Rhumb Line. Whatever works for you. Also, we're possibly gonna go up to visit the Manchester's for lunch on Sunday. Aaron is recovering from surgery and is hoping to have some visitors so that's another thing that's going on if you want to join of course everyone would love it.

You got this way of telling all your lies
kind that goes stealing hearts and minds
you make a fool out of me

every time you push me to the line 
unravel my disguise

Hi everyone just a reminder Block Island is July 9-16. I know it might not be possible for people to take that whole time off from work so feel free to pick the days that work for you during that time.

Frank and I switch off on dishes while the other two switch off emptying the machine. Our dishes have reached a pile beyond the sink water line so I texted Frank this morning asking whose turn it was to do it. He said it was his. And then I suggest maybe we should hand wash any dishes that don’t fit so we have an incentive to do them sooner. Because I also take forever. And his response was a paragraph saying he didn’t want to talk about chores when he’s at work, and he also mentioned how frustrating it was that we were talking about it

Feb 02, 2023  1:00:18 PM
Me
I don’t know if I’m overreacting but it felt like kind of harsh, and that’s been a pattern of his lately

Feb 02, 2023  1:01:47 PM (Read by you after 31 seconds)
+19787716952
I think the answer may be in the pattern of his - do you mean he’s more irritable? Or is it just about the chores?

Feb 02, 2023  1:02:26 PM
+19787716952
Also your suggestion is very reasonable and a good one! And usually sending a text like that during work should not warrant a snippy response.

Would this have anything to do with how music is taking off for all of you and not him? Or is something else going on for him that might make him edgy?

Feb 02, 2023  1:04:45 PM

Oh absolutely part of it

Feb 02, 2023  1:06:25 PM (Read by you after 19 minutes, 16 seconds)

Yeah I just wonder if he’s struggling with that and being grumpy about everything else?

Feb 02, 2023  1:15:39 PM (Read by you after 10 minutes, 2 seconds)
+19787716952
I think the best way to manage the grump is to just directly say ok let’s not talk about it at work what time this week does work for you to talk about chores?

Feb 02, 2023  1:16:17 PM (Read by you after 9 minutes, 24 seconds)
+19787716952
And then when he gets grumpy again check in and ask if everything is alright or if something is going on - is there anything you can help with or talk about?

Feb 02, 2023  1:56:19 PM
Me
I’m just not sure how to handle it because I also need to be self aware of myself and how I may be contributing to this. I just don’t know what to do with the music stuff because there’s definitely quite a bit of resentment over it

Feb 02, 2023  2:16:38 PM
+19787716952
All you can do is your best to be sensitive and kind (which you are). Frank will have to sort out his feelings about music as it’s really his thing to sort out. You can’t take that on for him. As far as the chores go as long as you ask for his feedback if there is anything you could be doing better, or if he’s got improvements to offer in the system you are using, you are fine.

Feb 02, 2023  2:17:33 PM
+19787716952
I think you absorb the energy of those around you and take them on as your responsibility so (if that’s true) just be mindful of what’s yours to manage and what is not.

Feb 02, 2023  2:52:32 PM
Me
Yeah I definitely do. And I can totally see how me playing 5+ hours a day everyday can be obnoxious and he was playing a while before me and I very quickly got better than him which would definitely make me self conscious

Feb 02, 2023  2:53:12 PM
Me
But I can’t help it I just like playing all day and it’s what I want to do

Feb 02, 2023  2:53:36 PM
Me
I get a vibe that he thinks some of it may just be to be better than he is

Feb 02, 2023  2:57:18 PM
Me
I don’t know a Common trend seems to be him being anxious and or self conscious and sort of projecting it on others a bit too much

Feb 02, 2023  2:58:58 PM
Me
I just don’t like the way he treats me recently and h feel like I apologize a lot, sort of walking on egg shells vibe

Feb 02, 2023  3:10:15 PM (Read by you after 6 minutes, 56 seconds)
+19787716952
If you are walking on eggshells generally that means you are giving his moods too much power

Feb 02, 2023  3:17:16 PM
Me
I definitely am

Feb 02, 2023  3:17:36 PM

But should he be controlling his moods more or should I stop caring about what he thinks

Feb 02, 2023  3:26:45 PM
+19787716952
You are only able to control your reactions. So learning to set boundaries is really important. What you will tolerate and what you won’t.

This video is outstanding, I love it and what a great groove you all have going. Glad to see Frank joining in. Remind me who the bass player is? This adds a cheerful touch to quite a scary morning. I think Shirley is going to be ok but probably a nice bruise and mild concussion - just my guess I was upstairs when she fell. I feel so bad for her. Aging is really rough.

That was SO fun! Not sure why I sent you three of the same pics haha. But so many great photos and videos. I will make sure I got them all to you. Can’t wait for the next one. March 18 jam at the Whale’s Jaw for sure and it will be a Saint Patty’s kind of vibe open to all musicians so definitely we are playing at that one.

Max! Just letting you know Block Island is Sunday July 9 - Sunday July 16. I would like everyone to arrive on the 9th. John and I will be heading back on that Thursday. Kelly and Aly want to stay the full week and may have some friends join that last weekend. You are welcome to do the same. Just wanted to let you know as it’s a ways off but we need to book car reservations for the ferry and all that stuff. I think I mentioned that the rental house is a bit remote so perfect for cookouts and jam sessions nonstop if you want!

I’m also texting to let you know that Sherry the pony is quite sick, it hit her on Friday and has gone downhill in spite of a lot of vet interventions. Clary is flying back from Scotland now due to land in Logan in a few hours. Basically to say goodbye, I’m not sure she will be with us much longer. Just wanted to tell you as you know all the horses here and are part of the farm family. It’s a deeply sad time at the farm right now. But also knowing a horse can have a peaceful end of life with no suffering is a good thing. I will keep you posed.

Sherry update - this morning was better for her and now she’s ok, not terrible but not as good. Clary is glad to be here and an active part of all of this. You are so right that the Seaview family is tight. Last night at the farm when Sherry was not doing so well John showed up with hot cider and bourbon and there were a lot of us including Ken and Sue just hanging by the stall. Sherry seems to have been liking the human attention. And I know Tristan and Clary feel very supported. Still not sure what is gong to happen.

[Verse 1]
Don’t see me as a disinterested
Yours are just uninhibited
You know I have my limitations
Always in dry situations

[Chorus]
She is simply everything to me
She is over anything to me

[Verse 2]
I can’t feel it anymore
The pull to fight and raise my score
Looking back on younger days
And all the hell that we would raise

(Chorus)

[Verse 3]
Now you’re off in god knows where
I sure hope you’re successful there
When you steep your evening tea
Do you ever go and think of me

(Chorus)

[Bridge]
I don’t need possession
I don’t need obsession
I don’t want a burden
Behind life’s curtain

She was simply everything to me
She was over anything to me

Stuck in parched lands, under spell

I can’t feel it anymore

No burden to bear, just progression
Freedom to live, without fate's strings
No more attachments, no more things

Lost in the stars, for eternity.”

My luck with my health is so comically bad the last few weeks. Been super sick, feeling ok finally. Wake up at 3 am with really intense deep ear pain and pressure. Pretty sure the excessive blowing my nose and coughing gave me a nasty ear infection

Well. That is my new horse (not really). Her name is Dee and I’m starting to take lessons on her! This is in Hamilton. She does fox hunts and is a very zippy full of energy girl. So it’s a great challenge but I loved it so much. I hadn’t ridden that much since my teens/twenties. I am SO tired. Tristan and I are taking lessons together. Isn’t she cute?

Also what week is your break so I can schedule the car

Also I’m slightly concerned about my ears and hearing the past few months, really the past year or so. I’m careful with my volume levels and it’s more of a fullness/pain/ringing that’s getting worse. I’m concerned it’s Eustachian tube dysfunction or something like that, because my ears can’t seem to hold any pressure. Like it’s when you need to pop your ears after a flight but all the time

Thanks for the heads up and that sounds pretty uncomfortable. It does seem to line up with the other sinus issues you have been having and maybe you’ve had ear infections that you didn’t know about?

Hey Max, I just spoke with Kelly Ford and they said that they had actually already fixed the AC compressor which completely escaped my mind. I thought we were putting it off till later but anyway, could you just check and see if it works and if it does, then you can just get an oil change and inspection locally and that'll be much easier.

You look really happy. I would love to meet her. I also have an idea about anxiety. This month has been hard for me too. I don’t know if this is the cause, but this is the time of year that things got really bad for GMa and PJake. The body remembers and reacts. The seasons changing definitely have affected me and stirred a lot of that up. I have started to work with an acupuncturist up here who does stuff around anxiety and grief and I found it very interesting. I’m going back in another week. It was a cool experience. I would be happy to connect you with her. It doesn’t hurt you don’t feel anything except for a kind of energy release when you are done. I can share more about it and it’s probably different for everyone but anyhow she is in Gloucester.

Also I figured Id let you know now, grad school and getting a MSW is what I want to do and is my priority. I just have some concerns about my ability to succeed. Over the last year or so the tinnitus ringing in my ears has gotten pretty bad, especially after the last ear infection. The ringing is always there but I am getting more used to tuning it out so its getting easier. But it is still extremely challenging to be in like any room that doest have intermittent sounds or white noise. And both of those usually have to be pretty loud or I will naturally tune into the ringing and freak out. Its not fun at all and is a huge struggle. My fear is the more I talk about it the more real it becomes and I will notice it more. So I am super hesitant to talk about it and If you ever want to check in on me don’t mention the tinnitus specifically just ask about my anxiety. But yeah, im concerned I won’t be able to sit in an exam room or a quiet classroom (not in an actual school type classroom) without needing my anxiety meds.

I highly suggest contacting this practice https://www.acupartners.com/. I think you hold so much stress in your body and this might be worth trying. They even say if you have a fear of needles they make it totally comfortable for you. I’ve gone twice to a very similar thing and it’s actually deeply relaxing. As always, anything medical/health related is covered by me so please if you are interested, send them a message. Looks like they are nearby in Lexington.

Hi!!! So, turns out getting a ride back from the dealer means I am going to drop my car off around 2:45 and I will leave the keys in it and take a screen shot where it is, but it will be in back like before in the service area. Then you can just arrive whenever you are able and go drop off your key, then take my car home. I will let them know you are coming. Ideally I would love to meet up at the same time but I’m not feeling entirely great and this way I can at least get the car where you need it. Also there will be a shirt in there for you. Hopefully this all makes sense!

Therapist for you, this message is from my therapist: Mel, my friend Randi Taylor is a talented psychologist and specializes in anxiety.  She is my age, calm, thoughtful and clear....and very smart.  I'd recommend her highly.  She says that she will have an opening in two to three weeks depending on your son's schedule.  She has an office in person and also works online.  Her office is in Acton.  Her cell is 615-584-7559 and have your son share my name with her if he reaches out so that she knows the context.  Hope that this helps!

Hi there! So I called Ford and they didn’t actually know your car was in the lot. I think it was a miscommunication that they needed you to go inside and let them know it was there. So no biggie but they are looking at it now and tomorrow I will have a sense of when it will be done!

It is strange it's not a big deal I mean it's fine. You have my car and I don't have any rush to get it back, but I'm I thought that when I went in and talk to him and explain to them what was gonna happen if that was enough notification that you were gonna be leaving the car but I guess they were still I don't know who knows anyway, no big deal and they are going to still be able to fix it and I am tomorrow. I'll have a better sense of how long that's going to take so anyway in other news how are you doing?

Sorry, that was probably more than 10 minutes. I had a little bit of trouble locating the can opener, but I found it and I swear if I go home and I find that can opener in like a really random place somebody's got dementia, and it could be me I don't know anyway, Windrush was fantastic. I loved it. I got to assist a man with mobility issues I am so I don't know what happen like how he was injured or whatever but it was so cool.

Yeah that’s tough. I will say too that this time of year is when things got really bad for Mom and Dad. And you were here for so much of that. I’ve definitely found that the body remembers and reacts even if we aren’t totally conscious of it. So I don’t know if this is part of it but just letting you know, some of this may be grief. And year 2 is a tough one.

I think you should try it and I’m really sorry it’s be so tough recently. I agree that things might feel worse temporarily. I think anxiety can be really physical for you so acupuncture could be very cool. There is also a kind of therapy called ART which is a fairly quick process that one of my clients just did with a trained person for trauma and it’s so interesting. Here is a link if you are interested:

I wanted to touch base about Block Island and the ferry info - your trip back as you know is at night on Sunday the 16th - you will have to leave the rental house way before the ferry which logistically is fine you can just park the car in the ferry lot and do whatever you want during the day. That was the only ticket available but it’s likely you can get on standby and leave earlier if you want. Hoping that’s ok. Aly is flying back earlier that evening so she will have to get one of her friends to drive her to the airport. But she and probably Nora and Rowan will all be driving down with you on the 9th. If you want Andrew or anyone to join you for that last weekend that’s great and if he just gets a passenger ticket he could hang with you and go back on the ferry with you. Maybe this is too detailed but I wanted to be sure everyone is good with the plans and let me know if you have any questions.

That’s so interesting that your head is less foggy. Melatonin does cause intense dreams. If it’s too disturbing there’s other stuff - I like zquill gummies which do have melatonin but a few other things that I think give more restful sleep. It’s not anything like NyQuil.

That’s really hard, and probably made worse as it’s the end of the year when teachers do feel the most burned out. It seems like that particular classroom is just not where you really want to be and that it’s affecting you. I think you have a great deal of empathy and sensitivity towards all of the kids and it’s just all getting to you. I hope you can get some rest this afternoon. If you have any energy maybe see about that acupuncturist, it won’t fix everything but it could possibly give you a little relief and maybe restore some energy. Keep me posted.

NOOOOOOO that’s the only weekend we are away, in NYC to see Goodnight Oscar. I’m so bummed. Well you will have to just keep booking more gigs. If you could play a duo or trio you could do farmers markets everywhere.

Farmers markets are great because it’s pretty low key, and people like personable musicians that create a nice vibe but it’s not a concert. They pay badly but you get tips and vegetables. I will see who runs Rockports. I would also look into the Haverhill one. That’s actually a really fun place to play.

Here’s some info on the Haverhill farmer’s market, no idea if they have booked musicians for the summer at this point but you should email them if you are interested!

Hey, sorry I missed your call. Tristan's new horse was arriving this afternoon so many people came down to support her and to meet him. I'll send you pictures pretty exciting day for her. I hope that you've had a good day and I can talk really anytime tomorrow so let's try to do that.

You should contact these people to see if they are still booking bands for downtown. They have small stage areas all over the place. They generally don’t pay so it’s one of those events that newer performers love to get experience. Ask about the downtown entertainment.
